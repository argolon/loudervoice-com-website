I was excited for a very short period this evening [when I spotted on Ryan Carson&#8217;s blog][1] that there was an opportunity for web app startups to get on stage for 10 minutes in front of the entire audience of [FOWA][2]. There were only three spots left. I was just about to shoot off an email saying &#8220;me me me&#8221; when I spotted the final line &#8220;The cost is Ã‚Â£5k&#8221;.

I&#8217;m still stunned. Surely the only start-ups that can afford to spend 5k are the ones who are already funded and who don&#8217;t actually need the PR? I was highly critical of LeWeb3 but Loic deserves great credit for the start-up room idea where the cost was a big fat zero. I would never begrudge anyone making a few quid but it seems like the highest cost is being targeted at those least able to afford it.

I attended Ryan&#8217;s &#8220;How to Build a Web App&#8221; Workshop in July which I highly recommend to everyone I meet. One of the strongest messages I took from that was not to waste a penny. I honestly imagine Ryan tut-tutting me every time I buy a wifi voucher at an airport. I&#8217;m also reminded that Ryan got all of the DropSend branding and UI done for Ã‚Â£5k.

I&#8217;m afraid Ã‚Â£5k for 10 minutes in front of a room of heavy hitters simply makes no sense from a self-funded startup ROI perspective. I&#8217;ll spend Ã‚Â£30 on a few pints to meet the people I really want to talk to.

I&#8217;ll be genuinely interested to see who does hand over the moolah to present.

UPDATE: It looks like [Jason Calacanis][3] and [Mike Arrington][4] agree with me. Here&#8217;s hoping we can get one of the slots at TechCrunch20.
