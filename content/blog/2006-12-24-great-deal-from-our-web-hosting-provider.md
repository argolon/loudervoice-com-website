We&#8217;ve been using [WebFaction][1] for all the LouderVoice hosting mainly because they come highly recommended by the [TurboGears][2] and Python communities (and donate to the TG project). So far we&#8217;ve been very happy with the service, performance and ease of deployment. Their recent launch of an API which allows people to script one-click installs of many applications for use by others has proven to be a very popular move.

They have just given [one more reason for using them][3]: They&#8217;ve added one long-running process and 40MB of RAM to all plans. Not only that but they&#8217;ve doubled the diskspace and quadrupled the bandwidth included in each plan.

They get my thumbs up.
