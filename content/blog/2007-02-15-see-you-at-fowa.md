I&#8217;m attending the [Future of Web Apps][1] conference in London next week. I arrive Monday night and leave on Thursday morning. They really have a great line up of speakers and I&#8217;m looking forward to it immensely. I&#8217;ve also signed up for the [Geek Dinner][2] with [Chris Messina][3] and [Tara Hunt][4] on the Wednesday night.

I hope to run into lots of you there. I should be on my super [Roam4Free][5] SIM card, in which case I&#8217;ll be at +372-531-66646. If not, it&#8217;s the usual +353-87-9790297 and conor@argolon.com.

Don&#8217;t forget to pop a comment up [on Web2Ireland][6] if you&#8217;d like to attend the Paddy dinner on the Tuesday night. Non-Paddies welcome ðŸ™‚
