Conor is on [The Right Hook][1] radio show this evening on Newstalk with Joe Drumgoole from [PutPlace][2]. He&#8217;ll be talking about the LouderVoice service in general and kicking off an SMS reviews push in conjunction with the show. You can listen live on the web here.

As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There&#8217;ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews. We also provide custom keywords for our business clients and partners.

And finally, our LouderVoice for Business site should be launching in the next few days.
