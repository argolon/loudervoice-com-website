We&#8217;ve been promising it forever and now we&#8217;re finally ready to unveil the all-new LouderVoice WordPress plug-in V2.0. This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.

The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from [Robin Blandford][1].

So what&#8217;s changed? Everything!

  * It is compatible with WordPress.org from V2.0.3 to the brand new V2.5
  * It now integrates into the normal blog-post editor instead of being a pop-up
  * The extra markup is no longer stored inline in the blog-post body so there is no danger of damaging the extra review information if you go back to edit a post
  * We&#8217;ve dropped the summary field and just use the first paragraph of the body as the summary
  * LouderVoice tags are optional, we can make use of tags from all the major tagging systems on WordPress including the built-in one
  * The plug-in pings LouderVoice when you post a new review. Indexing of new reviews should therefore be faster
  * The rating stars are stored locally in the plug-in dir so you can easily change them to suit yourself

What hasn&#8217;t changed? It is still microformats compliant and it is still GPL, so hack away if you want to change anything.

A big thanks to [John Blackbourn][2] for all the development effort.
