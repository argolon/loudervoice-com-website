This is the kind of news we love to get on a sunny Monday morning in West Cork. We have been shortlisted in the Innovation Category of the Irish Internet Association [Net Visionary Awards][1]. If you think we deserve the award then [why not head over and vote][2]? Don&#8217;t forget all the other categories too, lots of fantastic companies and people in there.
