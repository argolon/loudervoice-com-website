“It is no longer just about your website&#8230;” says [WSI][1] Sales and Marketing Director Tracy Spence, based in Northampton, “consumers are web savvy, and actively look for reviews before they decide to purchase online. Search engines have responded by looking for reviews and making websites with real reviews more prominent. The LouderVoice system addresses this very easily and helps our clients get found on the web and increases their sales conversion rate too.”

LouderVoice CEO Conor O&#8217;Neill highlighted: &#8220;Cobbled-together online offerings are just too complex for most local businesses. They need something powerful and they need it now with no extra work. This new LouderVoice-WSI package provides exactly that.&#8221;

LouderVoice can be found on the web-sites of every type of business. These Social-powered systems put authentic reviews on the client&#8217;s site, not some third-party hub. Deep integration with Facebook makes qualified Social traffic flow from there to the client, not the other way around. All of LouderVoice&#8217;s solutions are also SEO-optimized so that reviews deliver benefits wherever the customers are online.
