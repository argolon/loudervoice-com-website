At 4am this morning, we unlocked LouderVoice. An enormous amount of work has gone into this over recent weeks and we&#8217;re all pleased as punch with the result. A big thank you to Lee and Blair and everyone else who got it out the door.

[Head on over][1] and check it out. Sign up for an account and publish some reviews to your blog. There are still some teething problems in there but let us know what you think.

If you don&#8217;t have a blog, try our [ReviewBlogs site][2].

Heck maybe make your first review about LouderVoice!
