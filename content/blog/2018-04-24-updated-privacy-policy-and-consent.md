We have updated our [privacy policy](/privacy-policy/) to include GDPR provisions. This includes information on how to request that your personal information be deleted from our systems.

In addition, anyone submitting reviews using our solution on our clients' sites must now actively provide their consent that their name and email address can be shared with LouderVoice.
