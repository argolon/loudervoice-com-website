We&#8217;ve always been impressed with the [Citylocal franchise][1] which was built by Nazir Daud in the UK. Paul Brugger launched [the Cork site last year][2] and it has been growing at an amazing rate. CityLocal Cork is a Business Directory and community website that provides local information on Businesses, News, Events, Free Ads, Property and Cinema listings.

Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal&#8217;s customers will now see their reviews appearing on [loudervoice.com][3], on [Google Android][4] mobile phones and shared by users to [Facebook][5] and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.

Cork is just the first city we have added and you can expect more integration announcements in the coming months.
