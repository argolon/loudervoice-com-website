What a fantastic couple of weeks in the life of LouderVoice. Yesterday we found out we&#8217;ve been shortlisted for New Company of The Year by [The Irish Software Association][1]. This is one helluva heavy-duty event and we&#8217;re nervous about the interview process already.

There willÂ be lots more announcements and coverage in the next two weeks so watch closely.
