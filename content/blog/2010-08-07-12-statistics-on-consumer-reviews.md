There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews [over on Search Engine People][1]. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!

A few of their gems:

  1. **90%** of online consumers **trust** recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, **8% trust celebrities** (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)
  2. **70%** consult reviews or ratings **_before_ purchasing** (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)
  3. **7 in 10** who read reviews **share** them with friends, family & colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte & Touche, Sept. 2007)
  4. **45%** say they are **influenced** a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)

Thanks to Richard Hearne, [SEO god from Red Cardinal][2] for the link.
