We&#8217;re had some feedback from non-Twitter users that they&#8217;d like to try out LouderTweets but the original instructions were a bit obscure. Here is the step by step.

  1. You don&#8217;t need to have a LouderVoice account
  2. Sign Up for a [Twitter account here][1]. All you need to provide is name, username and email address
  3. You don&#8217;t need to invite anyone else in so skip that step
  4. Go over the the [&#8220;review&#8221; user&#8217;s page here][2]
  5. Click the &#8220;add&#8221; button to add them as a friend
  6. You&#8217;ll get an email shortly afterwards saying that &#8220;review&#8221; has added you as a friend too
  7. Go to your [main twitter page][3] and enter a review in the box as follows:
  8. @review 5 Barry&#8217;s Tea. The finest cuppa you are likely to find
  9. So the format is simply @review SPACE Rating SPACE Item Name PERIOD SPACE Review Text
 10. Here is [an example][4]
[![Sample Tweet 01][5]][6]

 11. Click the update button and you are done
 12. Within thirty minutes that review can be searched for over at LouderVoice
 13. Here is an [example of that][7]
[![Sample LouderVoice 01][8]][9]

 14. LouderVoice members can then rate your review, bookmark it or add it to a collection of bookmarks they are building and sharing with others. e.g. [Taste of Dublin Reviews][10]
 15. That&#8217;s all there is to it. Keep them coming!
