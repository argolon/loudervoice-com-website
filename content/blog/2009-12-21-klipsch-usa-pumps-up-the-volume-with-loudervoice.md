We really are jumping up and down with excitement to finally announce that LouderVoice&#8217;s first US client went live just before Le Web recently.Â [Klipsch USA][1] now has the LouderVoice customer review system across the entire klipsch.com web-site.

For those in Europe not familiar with this legendary US brand, it had defined high-end audio since 1946 and is adored by audiophiles everywhere.

We are thrilled to be working with such a fantastic US company and the Klipsch team was able to deploy our reviews system with minimal effort or support required.

LouderVoice reviews perform three functions for Klipsch. The on-site reviews drive up sales and help customers select the right product; the Facebook Connect & Twitter OAuth integration enables the already passionate customers to be evangelists; and finally the reviews on [www.loudervoice.com][2] give a conversion boost and even wider distribution.

The response from [Klipsch fans on Facebook][3] to our reviews system has been an absolute joy for us and we look forward to an ever growing body of reviews to help all Klipsch customers.

UPDATE 1: We&#8217;ve also published the announcement on the [IIA web-site][4].

UPDATE 2: [Great piece on the launch][5] from TechCrunch Europe. Thanks [Steve][6]!
