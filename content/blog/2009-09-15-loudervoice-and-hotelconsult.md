It&#8217;s always a pleasure to meet like-minded people who understand the power of online reviews for businesses. Pat O&#8217;Neill of [HotelConsult][1] is one of those people and we&#8217;re thrilled to be working with him in the hotel space.

In these difficult times for hotels, any advantage that they can gain is worthwhile. On-site reviews are a proven way of growing sales and on-site sales for hotels means they improve their margin.

Pat is a whirlwind of energy and his knowledge of this market is unrivalled. You can expect to see the new LouderVoice widget on a variety of hotel web-sites in the coming months.

We highly recommend you [follow his blog][2] for lots of insights into the business. If you are looking for some fantastic hotel bargains, then [follow him on Twitter][3] too.
