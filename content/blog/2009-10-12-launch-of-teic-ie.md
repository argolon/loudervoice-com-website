Today marks the launch of technology news and reviews site [teic.ie][1], which has to be one of the best site names we&#8217;ve seen!Â It&#8217;s written by Adam Maguire who is one of the finest technology and business journalists in the country. Adam&#8217;s reviews are in-depth and extremely knowledgeable. The use of a blog format means he should quickly see a community forming around the site and there is no reason we won&#8217;t have a European Gizmodo or Engadget on our hands.

We&#8217;re thrilled to be [aggregating all of the reviews][2] from tech.ie to help build it into the leading tech site in the country. [Head on over][3] and check out the launch day competition!
