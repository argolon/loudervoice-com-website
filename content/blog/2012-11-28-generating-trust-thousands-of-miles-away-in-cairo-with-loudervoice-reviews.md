The first thing I do when I land on a site I haven&#8217;t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.

We were really excited recently to sign-up [Floradoor][1] in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.

We always say that LouderVoice Reviews provides four key benefits for any business: SEO, Social, Feedback and TRUST. It&#8217;s that trust which is proving so powerful for Floradoor. They are getting [phenomenal reviews][2]Â from customers as far apart as the USA and Russia:

> SHE WAS STUNNED WITH JOY!!!!! THOSE ROSES COMING 8000 MILES AWAY FROM HER HOME! WOW!&#8230;.YOU MADE HER AND I SO HAPPY!

No matter where you are based, if you are selling online, you can sell globally. But only if potential clients have confidence that they can trust you. Like [Floradoor][1].
