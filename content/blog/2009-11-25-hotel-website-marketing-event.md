Yesterday I attended the excellent [Hotel Website Marketing][1] event in Dublin organised by [Proactiv Marketing][2]. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.

I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.

This is the deck I presented:
