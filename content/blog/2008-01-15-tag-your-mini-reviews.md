This is a little bit of a niche feature but several users have asked for it so we added tagging to mini-reviews on [LouderVoice][1]. The idea here is that normally if you send a review by [SMS][2] or [Twitter][3]/[Jaiku][4]/[Pownce][5] then it doesn&#8217;t have any user defined category like &#8220;wine&#8221; or &#8220;movie&#8221;. However, with &#8220;hashtags&#8221;, if you add these tags/labels onto your review then we&#8217;ll pick them up.

It is very easy to do, just prefix any words you want to use as tags/labels with # in your SMS or on Twitter/Pownce. For technical reasons you have to use a % on Jaiku.

So for example an SMS with:

**Review 5 Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc 2006: My favourite wine on the planet. Clean, crisp gooseberry flavours. For Chardonnay haters. #wine #New+Zealand**

will put that review into the user categories of &#8220;[wine][6]&#8221; and &#8220;[New Zealand][7]&#8221;

A few words of warning. Don&#8217;t go crazy with the tags as we currently don&#8217;t strip them out and too many will make the reviews unreadable. Also, we recommend putting them at the end of the review rather than in the middle of sentences.

This is an experimental feature and based on your feedback we may make it less flexible in the future so that the &#8220;#&#8221; symbols are removed from the reviews as they come in.

Let us know what you think.
