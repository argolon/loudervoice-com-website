The brilliant [LittleQuiz][1] site runs a different quiz each week with some fantastic prizes which could be yours by answering three simple questions. [This week][2] those questions are about LouderVoice. Head on over and you could be in with a chance to win a mobile phone and call credit.

If you are a business looking for simple effective promotional opportunities, I can highly recommend talking to Joe Scanlon who runs the site.
