One of the most common requests we get from partners and customers is to have the same reviews SEO functionality on ASP.NET as they do for PHP and WordPress sites. And we&#8217;re delighted to say that this is now available.

All of our Packages provide Google Juice and Star Ratings in Search results to client sites via our review Hub, [LouderYou][1]. The advantage of this approach is ease of deployment. Our code can be added in seconds to a web-page and reviews are then live. Those reviews are indexed on our hub within hours.

However, many clients would also like to see Star Ratings in search associated directly to their own site. Our PHP clients have long had this ability and now, finally, so too do our ASP.NET clients.

It means that ASP.NET sites can also have results like this in Google Search:

    Our Add-On works with ASP.NET 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 sites and has been deployed on a variety of hosting providers such as GoDaddy, Blacknight and Microsoft Azure. The sites must be able to accept Custom Server Controls, which means that, for the moment, CMS systems like DotNetNuke are not supported (but will be soon!). Most standard ASP.NET sites should have no problems.
