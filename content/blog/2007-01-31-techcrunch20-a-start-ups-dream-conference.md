[Jason][1] and [Mike][2] have announced the TechCrunch20 conference and it has a wonderful twist &#8211; 20 startups get to present and it costs them nothing to do so, unlike many [others][3]. It&#8217;s being held on the West Coast in the <strike>Autumn</strike> Fall. Whether we get a slot or not I think this is shaping up to be something very special. Well done to the two guys for this beautifully disruptive move.
