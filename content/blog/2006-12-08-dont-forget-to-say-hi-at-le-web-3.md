The Cork crew are taking an early flight on Sunday and arriving CDG at 13:45. If anyone wants to hook up at any stage, just call me or text me (Conor) on +353-87-9790297. I&#8217;m aiming to be at [this party][1] on Sunday night and the official one on Monday night. I have to leave early afternoon on Tuesday so don&#8217;t forget to catch that pigeon.
