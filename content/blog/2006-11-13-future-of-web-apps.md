Registration has just opened for the next [Future of Web Apps][1] conference in London on Feb 20-22. I&#8217;ve just signed up to attend. I should have PLENTY to talk about at that stage. Anyone else thinking of heading over from Ireland? It&#8217;s a great line-up of speakers including Mike Arrington, Bradley Horowitz, Tara Hunt and Jeremy Keith.
