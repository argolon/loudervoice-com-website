The fourth week of [the competition][1] (and final week of this phase) is over and we can now announce the winner of a [Hairy Baby][2] t-shirt.

Congratulations to CiarÃƒÂ¡n Rooney, an Irish guy living in London, who wins with his complimentary review of AerLingus.com phone customer support. The review, which he wrote [on Jaiku][3], currently tops Google for &#8220;Aer Lingus Support&#8221;.</p>
