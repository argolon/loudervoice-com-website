We&#8217;d love it if you would send us all your live mini-reviews of the two day [Oxegen][1] music festival.

Here are all the instructions for [Jaiku][2] users and for first-time mini-reviewers. [Twitter][3] instructions are coming in another post.

To send reviews of Oxegen from your phone to us, you do not have to be signed up on LouderVoice. All you have to do is this:

  * [Sign Up here][2] on the wonderful Finnish site Jaiku
  * Join [the #oxegen channel][4] there
  * [Register your mobile number][5] with them
  * Start sending your reviews by SMS to +46 737 494 0501 in the following format:
  * #oxegen 5 Queens of the Stone Age. Greatest band on the planet. Live set blew my mind
  * So the format is: #oxegen RatingOutOf5 Thing. ReviewText

That&#8217;s it!

The first fullstop+space between the thing you are reviewing and the review is important so we know which is which.

Within a minute your review will be visible on the [#oxegen channel][4] and within 30 minutes that review will be searchable/rateable/bookmarkable/shareable on [LouderVoice][6].

All of the Oxegen mini-reviews (whether via Twitter or Jaiku) will be visible [here on LouderVoice][7].

This is not a premium SMS number so the cost of sending texts just depends on your plan. It costs me around 21c on Voda.

We&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d give it a try. Let us know here if you have any problems or questions.

If it works well for you, maybe consider signing up on [LouderVoice][6] and writing some full reviews afterwards.

Our site can index reviews you write on Blogger, WordPress, Typepad, our own [ReviewBlogs][8] site and several others.
