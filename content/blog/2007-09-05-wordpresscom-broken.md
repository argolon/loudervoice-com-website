Just a quick note to all our wordpress.com reviewers. Right now you will get an error if you post reviews from LouderVoice to this site. They broke something over the weekend which interferes with remote publishing of blog posts.

We are not the only ones suffering with this, Flock and BlogDesk are too. The basic problem is that whilst the post actually succeeds, the wordpress.com site returns an invalid response when we ask for the URL of the new post. In Flock&#8217;s case it just hangs.

We are looking at workarounds and have raised the issue on the WordPress forums. As soon as the status changes we&#8217;ll let you know. Note this does NOT affect self-installed wordpress.org blogs.
