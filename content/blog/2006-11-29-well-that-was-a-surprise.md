<a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com" rel="colleague">Sam Sethi</a> over at TechCrunch UK&I has done [a blog post about LouderVoice][1], saying 

> LouderVoice one to catch at Le Web 3

I&#8217;m blushing just writing it. There goes all our expectation setting out the window! We&#8217;re thrilled to get the coverage and I hope we can live up to it.

Due to the oddness of flight times from Ireland to France, the Cork contingent will actually be arriving early afternoon on Sunday 10th Dec. If anyone else is around on Sunday, I&#8217;d love to meet up. Catch me on +353-87-9790297 or email me in advance at conor@loudervoice.com. We might even try to organise a dinner on the Sunday night.
