Usually this is quoted as a negative but in our case it is entirely positive. The TechCrunch coverage lit a little fire underneath us and pushed me to finally get some lovin&#8217; applied to the design of the prototype. We have engaged a superb designer who I met at BarCamp Ireland to just do something quick and simple for next week. The timeline is crazy but his first proposal was absolutely spot-on and we&#8217;re running with it. It is a clean, uncluttered, intelligent design to match the \*cough\*, clean, uncluttered, intelligent application. Now we just have to try and tie everything together for Friday.
