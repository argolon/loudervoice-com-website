As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.

Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.

We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with &#8220;RE&#8221; (or one of our partners&#8217; keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.

We are now enabling the same feature on Twitter and want to get some guidance from our users. Below is a PollDaddy poll asking which method you would like us to use. If you don&#8217;t like any of them, enter your suggestion in &#8220;Other&#8221;.
