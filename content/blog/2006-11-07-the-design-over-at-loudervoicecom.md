I just commented over at [Eirepreneur][1] that you should pay no attention to the design of the landing page at l[oudervoice.com][2]. That is literally the default page in any [TurboGears][3] app with the text changed. In fact the server is not even running TG yet. We&#8217;ll do that when we add a sign-up for beta facility in the coming weeks.
