We are more than a little pleased to announce this.

**American + Ireland Social Media Leaders Join Forces**

_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: San Jose, CA; Austin, TX; and Cork, Ireland: July 3, 2012_ &#8211; Three Social Media leaders have come together to offer a compelling solution for restaurants and foodservice companies, beginning in the US. [FohBoh.com][1] of San Jose, CA, [LouderVoice Reviews][2] of Cork, Ireland, and [Restaurant Domain][3] of Austin, TX, can now provide a complete online Social solution to the food industry.

As the world of Social Media accelerates and changes daily, it can be hard for those in the foodservice field to feel in control and up-to-date. To ease those concerns, FohBoh&#8217;s Social Restaurant Community and their FOHBuzz SnapShot Social Media Report Card, LouderVoice&#8217;s Social Reviews, and Restaurant Domain’s Social Web Platform is wrapped into a single integrated offering that is fully customized for all levels of the industry. Any foodservice business from large multinationals to small family restaurants can have their online presence live, monitored and social-powered with almost no effort.

“Social media tools, while powerful, are really tactics. These tactical elements are there to support the restaurants online social hub, or the website, which is now mission critical. The first step is creating and growing a social media presence is the website that acts as a hub for managing the customer experience.” said FohBoh founder and CEO Michael L. Atkinson

With 65% of restaurants owning a website, very few have been upgraded to include integrated social features. This is a big opportunity to create a plug-n-play social website product that integrates social marketing, loyalty, rewards, reviews, CRM and reputation management.

“Over time, Restaurant Domain website creator will include a host of features and tactical social elements that make each website a command station easily adding the most current and valuable social media tools to help restaurants be more competitive and successful in a world powered by conversation.” Says Creed Ford IV, CEO of Restaurant Domain.

LouderVoice CEO Conor O&#8217;Neill highlighted: &#8220;Piecemeal online offerings simply don&#8217;t add-up for most businesses. They need something that just works, straight out of the box. By partnering with FohBoh and PMG, we are turning the Social Media Challenge into the Social Media Opportunity for all foodservice operations.&#8221;
