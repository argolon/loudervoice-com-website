We were terribly disappointed last Thursday that massive flooding in West Cork prevented us from attending the 2009 [Golden Spiders Awards][1]. The awards are the most high profile in Ireland and a win can have serious business benefits locally.

So imagine our shock to hear that [we won the e-business category][2]! We were up against some incredibly impressive competition. Getting this recognition from our industry peers on the judging panel really is satisfying.

The timing couldn&#8217;t be better. November sees us announce our 2009 BES for investors, win that award, launch on our first major US site (stay tuned!),Â  and announce our channel partner program (also stay tuned!). You can expect even more big announcements at [Le Web][3] in Paris on Dec 9th and 10th.

A huge thanks to [Sabrina Dent][4] who designed this new site with zero notice and accepted the award on our behalf. The LouderVoice business reviews service itself has been built by a great distributed team assisting us, including [Bartosz Ptaszynski][5], [Lukasz Baczynski][5] and [Blair Millen][6].
