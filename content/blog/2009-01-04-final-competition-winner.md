We should have posted this before Christmas but the finalÂ winner in the Three competition was Gabriel Kelly from Carrigaline in Cork for her review of theÂ [Philips DCP951/05][1].

Â 

One of the prize phones fromÂ [Three][6]Â and Custom-1 headphones fromÂ [Klipsch][7]Â are already on their way to her.

Well done to all the winners and thanks again to George Hook for making this all happen.

We&#8217;ll be kicking off some new competitions shortly. Keep an eye out here, [on Twitter][8]Â or on the site itself for details.
