[Julian from Bubble Brothers][1] let us know about the wonderful [Wine Blogging Wednesday][2] community and what they get up to.

The idea is simple: Different bloggers propose ideas for themes or topics for each month and one becomes the host for the month. Participating bloggers then buy a wine that is consistent with the theme and blog their tasting notes on or before the Wednesday of the event. All of the opinions are then summarised and linked to on a roundup page.

The theme for Wine Blogging Wednesday 42 is &#8220;Just Seven Words&#8221;. The wine should be an Italian Red. Yes, you read that right, they want you to review an Italian Red in JUST SEVEN WORDS. The wine name, type, producer, vintage do not have to be included in the seven. Compact descriptive terminology will be the order of the day.

We contacted Andrew from [Spittoon][3] who is hosting WBW 42 and he is happy for [LouderVoice][4] users to take part. Not only that but, as always with LouderVoice, you can use any of the platforms we support so your review can be on a blog, via SMS, Twitter, Jaiku or Pownce.

The only thing we ask is that whatever approach you use, you tag the review with &#8220;wbw42&#8221;. This means we can point Andrew to all the reviews as a collection in one place on LouderVoice [like this][5].

So for SMS, Twitter and Pownce:

For Jaiku:
  
**Review Rating1to5 DetailsOfWine: JUST SEVEN WORDS ALLOWED HERE. %wbw42**

Review 2 Due Lira Chuck 2006: Nasty, turpentine aroma with a diesel aftertaste. %wbw42

For Bloggers:
  
Just a usual LouderVoice review post with one of the tags/labels set to **wbw42** 

They want all of the reviews to be posted on _February 13th_. We&#8217;ll give you a reminder ahead of time but you can &#8220;practice&#8221; in the meantime, just don&#8217;t tag with wbw42 (but maybe use #wine). Let us know what you think.

I may try it tonight ðŸ™‚

p.s. Bloggers &#8211; we have a new ultra-lightweight way of getting your reviews indexed by us. No writing forms, no plugins, just a standard blogpost with a few tags. The next post here will tell you all the details. It should be perfect for this 7 word challenge.
