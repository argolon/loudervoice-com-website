Wow.

Jolie O&#8217;Dell just did the [Top Ten International Web Products of 2009][1] on the always brilliant [ReadWriteWeb][2].

We didn&#8217;t make the Top Ten yet but that&#8217;s OK, we&#8217;ll be there in 2010 ðŸ™‚

What we did make was the [Honourable Mentions list][3]!

The only Irish web company to do so.

The Golden Spiders award was national recognition for what we&#8217;ve been doing this year and now this is global.

To be in the same story as Spotify, Moshi Monsters, Tweetmeme and all the others is a real honour.

Thanks Jolie, Richard and all the RWW crew for the vote of confidence. Any of y&#8217;all going to be at Le Web?
