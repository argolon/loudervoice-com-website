We&#8217;ve just started rolling out invites to current beta testers to point their LouderVoice accounts at their own blogs instead of our reviewblogs. There are still one or two small glitches to iron out but overall things are very solid. The braver testers can go ahead and try to figure it out for themselves! Otherwise we&#8217;ll be sending out the instructions in the coming days.

A big thanks to our Swedish guru for managing to get us working with the new Blogger platform using the old API!

We are now racing towards code completion and a design revamp with an eye to soft-launching in April. We also have a few neat little side-projects on-going which will be ready around the same time and will add to the overall site value.
