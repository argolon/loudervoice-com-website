Pat Phelan from Cubic Telecom came up with the great idea of getting attendees to review what catches their eye at [3GSM][1] in Barcelona from Feb 11th to 14th. So if you are going, we&#8217;d love to get your insights via any of the review methods we support. Just follow these easy steps:

  * [Sign-up to LouderVoice][2] if you haven&#8217;t already
  * In &#8220;My Settings&#8221; add as many of these sources as you like: 
      * Mobile phone number for SMS reviews
      * Twitter/Jaiku/Pownce accounts for microblog mini-reviews
      * Blog RSS feed for Flag Tag Reviews
  * Then you send reviews as follows:
