It&#8217;s that time of the year again! LouderVoice has been at [Le Web][1] every year since 2006. Back then, it was just some ideas and a very basic Alpha, this time we are part of the Irish Pavilion.

[Enterprise Ireland][2] has put together a unique Demozone at Le Web. [11 hot Irish start-ups][3] including LouderVoice will be there. A single place where we can meet, have a coffee and show you what we do. This is the first time a country has exhibited at Le Web and we are honoured to be part of it.

I will be arriving Tuesday and leaving Friday. If you want to meet up at any stage, just pop on over to the Demozone. Hope to see you there!
