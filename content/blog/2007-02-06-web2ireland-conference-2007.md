I can&#8217;t emphasise enough how important the Web2Ireland event [in DCU last year][1] was to the creation of LouderVoice. We simply wouldn&#8217;t be doing it if it wasn&#8217;t for some of the deep insights that were offered by a panel of world-class speakers. In particular, the talk given by Judy Gibbons [was the trigger][2] which caused me to say &#8220;yes I now know I can go for this&#8221;.

So the guys n gals are starting to plan the 2007 event and need to gauge interest. Head on over and [vote in the poll][3].
