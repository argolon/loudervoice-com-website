We announced LouderTweets recently, which are 140 character mini-reviews you can send to [LouderVoice][1] from [Twitter][2] without needing a LouderVoice account.

Last night we turned on LouderViesti which is the equivalent feature for the superb [Jaiku][3]. Jaiku is like Twitter but can do much much more. They are based in Finland and are adding great features at a fast rate.

We are now calling LouderTweets+LouderViesti = LouderMinis!

Using LouderViesti is even easier than LouderTweets.

  * Sign Up on [Jaiku][4] if you are not already a member
  * Join the [#reviews channel][5]
  * On the #reviews channels page, write reviews using the following format:
  * RatingOutOf5 Item Name. Review Text
  * For [example][6]:
  * 3 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. Cheap for Marlborough. Not at Villa Maria or Montana level
  * That&#8217;s it! Within 30 minutes [that review][7] will be searchable/rateable/bookmarkable/shareable on LouderVoice

Of course if you have registered your mobile with Jaiku, you can send reviews from that too

  * Just send a text message to +46 737 494 0501 in the following format:
  * #reviews 3 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. Cheap for Marlborough. Not at Villa Maria or Montana level
  * That&#8217;s all there is to it! Give it a twirl. We have some fun ideas for it that we&#8217;ll announce next week
