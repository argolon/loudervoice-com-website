More and more sites are moving to [WordPress][1] as their platform. We have long been WP users and all of our sites are built on it.

The LouderVoice reviews system has always supported WordPress sites but we recently decided to make it even easier to deploy on them.

The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.

You need no technical experience to install and setup the plugin.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>It really is that easy</strong></em></span>!

Here is how you add reviews to any page on the site.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

In addition to being simple to install, it provides a major SEO benefit by making the reviews directly indexable by Google so that they can appear as star ratings in Search results.

It can generate code for English, Spanish, Italian and French sites. The admin screens themselves will be localised soon. Of course it is fully WP multi-site compatible.
