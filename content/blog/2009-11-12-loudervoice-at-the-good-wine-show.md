</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  LouderVoice has collaborated with hosts <a href="http://bubblebrothers.com" target="_blank">Bubble Brothers</a>, <a href="http://curiouswines.ie" target="_blank">Curious Wines </a>and <a href="http://karwigwines.ie">Karwig Wines</a> to enable everyone attending the show the chance to review everything they drink and eat. It couldn&#8217;t be simpler. Customers can text or twitter their opinions on the 100+ wines and food available.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing which wines and food are the most popular and hearing all the feedback on the two days.
