The [IIA][1] is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called &#8220;[8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff][2]&#8220;, it&#8217;s all about selling online and multi-channel. 

The focus this time is &#8220;Content and Analysis&#8221; and therefore it&#8217;s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we&#8217;ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.

The event itself is a real bargain at €99 and they even have further discounts for early bookers. It&#8217;s on next Thursday 3rd March in the Burlington Hotel in Dublin. We look forward to seeing you there.
