The [Taste of Cork Food Festival][1] is coming this weekend in the deep south of Ireland. There will by myriad stands offering food and beverages to sample including lots of famous Munster Artisan producers.

</p>

We&#8217;re partnering with several of the exhibitors including [Ummera][2] and [Bubble Brothers][3] to encourage those who attend to review both the event and the individual stands. Reviews can be submitted by any of the usual methods but [SMS][4] seems the most appropriate. Keep an eye out for our flyers on the stands.

And we have an absolute corker of a prize for the most popular review. It&#8217;s a BBQ Hamper from [Spicendipity][5], a new Irish online food store which literally launched today! They sell homemade sauces and 100% natural spice mixes and baking mixes.

The prize contains:

  * Two bottles of their signature Two Brew BBQ Sauce to slather your chicken, ribs, or steak
  * One Italian Seasoning Mix, perfect for dips and marinades
  * One Tex Mex Spice Mix, ideal for spicy dips and meat rubs
  * One Beer Bread Mix for the perfect accompaniment to your meal
  * One Brownie Mix for the perfect ending
  * A BBQ cookery book, grill tongs, bamboo skewers and a tea towel to mop it all up with.

The Taste of Cork event runs from Friday 27th to Sunday 29th in the old City Gaol in Sunday&#8217;s Well. The more reviews you write, the better chance you have of winning. We&#8217;ll keep the competition open until Sunday 6th July to give you plenty of time to get those reviews in and increase your viewing figures.

Based on the reviews of [Taste Of Dublin][6] recently, this should be a great few days.
