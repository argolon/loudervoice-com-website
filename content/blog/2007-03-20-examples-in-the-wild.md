We should be enabling external blog publishing on LouderVoice this week. Just to give you some sense of how things look in the wild, here are some of the test blogs we are using. We should be adding Blogger to the list this afternoon:

  * WordPress MU: [LouderVoice Review Blogs][1]
  * WordPress.org: [Bandon Blog][2]
  * WordPress.com: [d&#8217;Other Blog][3]
  * Movable Type: [I love it, I love it not][4]
