We&#8217;ve been terribly quiet on the LV Blog for which we must apologise. We&#8217;ve spent the past few weeks frantically getting ready for the next upgrade of the site.

Keep your eyes peeled over the next seven days for lots of new goodies. The plan is to release the features in iterative fashion over the space of a couple of weeks to give each one the attention it deserves. We&#8217;ll be adding lots more help too to guide you through each part of the site.

Once we are done with that, we&#8217;ll immediately begin building our major overhaul which will be out before the end of the year. This will include all of those things we wanted to launch with but just ran out of time.

As always, keep the suggestions flowing. We have added every one of them to the roadmap!
