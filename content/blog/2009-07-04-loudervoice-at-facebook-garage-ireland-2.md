We had a fantastic time at the second [Irish Facebook Garage][1] in Dublin on Thursday. A packed room of approx 150 people with a wide range of backgrounds heard 5 speakers cover a variety of topics over the space of 2.5 hours.

There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on [Web2Ireland][2] at some point next week. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of Conor&#8217;s live demo of the LouderVoice reviews widget + Facebook Connect in action. This widget will be formally launched in the next week or so.
