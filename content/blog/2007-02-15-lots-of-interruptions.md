We&#8217;re doing a ton of changes over the next few days in preparation for the Beta2 launch. You&#8217;ll see all of the current sites appear and disappear at random. Please be patient with us. The main tasks are to move from a shared host to a VPS and to start using www for everything instead of beta.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re gonna like the changes. Not only that, but those of you who have been wondering what ever happened to your beta invite only have a few more days waiting left to do. We&#8217;ll be adding blocks of users each day once we launch. The target is Monday for re-launch but I know that&#8217;s being very aggressive so it may be a few days later. I may even launch the new site whilst sitting at a talk in FoWA!
