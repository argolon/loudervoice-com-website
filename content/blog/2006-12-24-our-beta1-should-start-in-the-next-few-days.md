The system is up and running solidly for the past few days out on the interwebs. I had hoped to start Beta1 invites today but there are still one or two problems which I really want to get closed before we do. I&#8217;m also working on the test guidelines, roadmap and known-problems lists. As soon as we&#8217;re ready, I&#8217;ll let you know.

If you are even remotely interested in trying out Beta1 or Beta2, head on over to [the main landing page][1] to sign up.

Happy Christmas from the LouderVoice team!
