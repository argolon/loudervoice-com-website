Many of our clients on PHP platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal have long benefited from our SEO Add-On.

All of our Packages provide Google Juice and Star Ratings in Search results to client sites via our review Hub, [LouderYou][1]. The advantage of this approach is ease of deployment. Our code can be added in seconds to a web-page and reviews are then live. Those reviews are indexed on our hub within hours.

However, many clients would also like to see Star Ratings in search associated directly to their own site. We can now confirm that our PHP Add-on works perfectly with [Expression Engine][2].

It means that Expression Engine sites can also have results like this in Google Search:

We have found that deployment takes just an extra few minutes over our JavaScript solutions. A simple template change is all that is required.

Any questions at all about this, drop us a line via email or on Live Chat.
