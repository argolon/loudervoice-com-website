I&#8217;m heading over to [the second Irish BarCamp][1] in Waterford this Saturday. I currently don&#8217;t plan to give any talks as I have had zero time to prepare anything (darned start-ups!). I will be on one of the panels and I&#8217;ll be actively contributing to lots of the discussions (like [Donncha][2]&#8216;s).

If you spot me, do say hello. I&#8217;m staying the Saturday night so there&#8217;ll be tons of time to shoot the breeze.

I&#8217;ve got space for four others in the car and only one slot is taken, so if you are anywhere en-route from Bandon to Waterford, I&#8217;m happy to offer a lift.
