If you have any interest in Cloud Computing then you should be attending next week&#8217;s [Cloud Computing Summit][1] in Croke Park in Dublin.

The line-up of speakers is fantastic and the topics very relevant to businesses of any size. [LouderVoice][2] CEO, Conor, will be on a user panel speaking about our experiences of moving all the LouderVoice services to Amazon AWS. That includes S3, EC2, EBS, EIP, Cloudfront and only excludes ELB since it hasn&#8217;t launched in Europe yet.

We thought it would be a nice tie-in to have our cloud-based services running on the Cloud Summit site, so our new reviews widget has been [deployed on the site here][3]. Site developers [DMAC Media][4] had the widget up and running in a few minutes with full Facebook Connect and Twitter OAuth integration.

We&#8217;ll remind you on the day and afterwards to let conference organisers [iQuest][5], The Sunday Business Post, the Irish Software Association and The National Digital Research Centre know what you thought of the event by writing your review.
