We are incredibly happy to announce that [Klipsch][1] has just launched its [UK specific site][1]. Not only are they selling amazing audio equipment but the reviews there are powered by [LouderVoice][2].

When you are investing Â£1000 in a sub-woofer, you want to be sure you are picking the right one. Reviews by other customers can help you make that decision. The Klipsch guys understand that those reviews are a win-win for everyone.

We&#8217;ll be announcing more great Klipsch news in the next two weeks.
