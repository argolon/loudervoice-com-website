[Paul][1], [Ken][2] and a few others including myself have agreed to a bit of a challenge in the run up to the Irish Blog Awards. Basically whoever gets the largest percentage increase in RSS subscribers via Feedburner between now and then will do well on the drinks front on awards night. So if you are one of those readers who just pops over here regularly via your browser, why not consider adding this blog to your RSS reader?

Users of desktop feedreaders like Awasu or Thunderbird have to add the feed manually. Just copy this URL in:

<http://feeds.feedburner.com/Loudervoice>

Users of the built-in feedreader in Firefox or Internet Explorer 7 just have to click the orange RSS icon in the address bar or toolbar of their respective browsers.

Users of online feedreaders like Bloglines can select from one of the following:

<!-- feedbutton code -->

<!-- end feedbutton code -->

Go on, you know it makes sense.
