We now have hReview plug-ins available for WordPress.org v2.0.x/v2.1.x and WordPress MU v1.2.1

These plug-ins allow you to write correctly formatted reviews directly on your blog that our site and several others can collect and interpret properly. You no longer have to visit the LouderVoice site to write your reviews!

Once you write a review using the plug-in (simply by clicking &#8220;Insert Review&#8221; when writing any blog post) we will collect it and make it searchable on [LouderVoice][1].

You can grab them over at our [extras page][2] our just use these links:

[For WordPress.org][3]

[For WordPress MU][4]

Many thanks to [John Blackbourn][5] for developing these plug-ins for us.
