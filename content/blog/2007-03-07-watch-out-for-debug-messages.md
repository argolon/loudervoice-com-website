We hit a hard-to-reproduce bug yesterday on the main site and we&#8217;re trying to get to the bottom of it. One thing we&#8217;ve done is turn on debug messages so if anything goes wrong you may find yourself facing a screen full of red text. If you do, it&#8217;d be a huge help ifÃ‚Â  you could copy n paste it into a mail and send to beta1 at loudervoice dot com.Ã‚Â  In fact if you spot any anomalies at all, please let us know so we can improve the stability for everyone.

Thanks!
