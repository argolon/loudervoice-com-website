We were delighted to get two pieces on LouderVoice in the [Irish Examiner][1] newspaper recently. On Friday Feb 1st, Bernie Goldbach did a great column focused on mini-reviewing which he [re-posted on his blog][2].

Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it. Apologies for the roughness of the scan and for not OCRing it. The photograph is by Denis Minihane. Click on picture to see high-res original.
