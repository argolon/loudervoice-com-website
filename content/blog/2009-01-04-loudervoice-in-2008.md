We&#8217;ve had a fantastic year in [LouderVoice][1] and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:

  * In January we launched [Flag Tag reviewing][2] which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.
  * We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support
  * In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the [Irish Blog Awards][3]
  * In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.
  * We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)
  * We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering
  * In July we started using [Get Satisfaction][4] for Customer support. Don&#8217;t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.
  * In September we launched [Simple SMS reviews][5] requiring just a single keyword
  * We were also Shortlisted in the [Irish Web Awards][3]
  * In October we launched [LouderVoice for Business][6] to great attention
  * We were also [shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards][7]
  * And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors
  * In November, our first B2B client, [Klipsch][8], went live
  * In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009
