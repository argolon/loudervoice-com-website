Damien Mulley has just launched a new site called [Profile Ireland][1] with a simple laudable aim &#8211; to profile tech startups in Ireland. Each post consists of some useful information about a company plus some Q&A. I love the format and it will be extremely useful for anyone looking for a one-stop-shop for information on all of those companies.

He profiled [LouderVoice here][2].
