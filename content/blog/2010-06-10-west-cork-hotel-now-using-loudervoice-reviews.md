The hospitality industry is a big focus for LouderVoice at the moment. Hotels have long led the way in their use of technology to grow sales and build stronger relationships with their customers.

[West Cork Hotel][1] is based in Skibbereen in Co Cork and has been doing an amazing job with revamping every aspect of the business and then getting that message out to the world through Facebook and Twitter.

With [the addition of LouderVoice][2] they can now benefit from everything that our reviews system offers including:

  * Customer feedback direct to them, not just via sites like TripAdvisor
  * That feedback being visible for all potential guests to see. This gives invaluable qualitative information to those considering a booking
  * SEO improvements both directly on-site and via [LouderYou][3]
  * Facebook and Twitter integration so guests can tell their friends all about their stay

[West Cork Hotel][1] would make a fantastic case study for anyone looking at how online activities can help small local businesses get a global reach. We&#8217;re really pleased to have them as clients and look forward to seeing your reviews of them.
