We&#8217;re attending [TheNextWeb Conference][1] in Amsterdam on June 1st. It looks like it will be an awesome day and we are aiming to show off LouderVoice to a big audience. The organisers have put together an awards site and we&#8217;d really appreciate a vote for LouderVoice in [the Beta & Stealth Category][2]. Whilst you are there, a vote for [Pixenate][3] in the [Disruptors Category][4] would make a lot of sense!
