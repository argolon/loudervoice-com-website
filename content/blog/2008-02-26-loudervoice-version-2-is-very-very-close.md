We&#8217;ve been working round the clock to get the next version of [LouderVoice][1] out the door. We are within a hair&#8217;s breadth now! What can you expect to see?

  * A big redesign with a much busier home page to enable you to explore the site more easily
  * Reviews and comments in-site so you no longer need a blog to write full reviews
  * Review images
  * Instant sign-up
  * Instant sign-up via SMS
  * Community features enabling you to follow other users and see their activity on the site
  * Avatar images
  * Review Drafts
  * A new voting system
  * Major improvements to tag navigation
  * Basic support for Google Maps
  * A faster search back-end
  * And a ton of other under the hood improvements

Keep an eye out, we know you&#8217;re going to like it.
