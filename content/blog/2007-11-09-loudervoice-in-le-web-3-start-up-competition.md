We are absolutely delighted to announce that [LouderVoice][1] made it to the final 30 of the [Le Web 3 Start-Up competition][2] in Paris in December. We are the only Irish company to make it through and our 10 minutes of fame happens at 2.30pm on December 11th.

The eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed several recent changes to the site. We released them quietly but will be telling you all about them in the coming days. The plans for December are even more exciting again!
