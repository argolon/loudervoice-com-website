If you are a Twitter user and want to send reviews of [Oxegen][1] from your phone to us, you do not have to be signed up on LouderVoice. All you have to do is this:

  * Add the [the oxegen user][2] as a friend on Twitter. You&#8217;ll be added back within a few minutes.
  * [make sure your mobile number is registered][3] with them
  * Start sending your reviews by SMS to +447624801423 in the following format:
  * @oxegen 5 Queens of the Stone Age. Greatest band on the planet. Live set blew my mind
  * So the format is: @oxegen RatingOutOf5 Thing. ReviewText

That&#8217;s it!

The first fullstop+space between the thing you are reviewing and the review is important so we know which is which.

Within 30 minutes that review will be searchable/rateable/bookmarkable/shareable on [LouderVoice][4].

All of the Oxegen mini-reviews (whether via Twitter or Jaiku) will be visible [here on LouderVoice][5].

This is not a premium SMS number so the cost of sending texts just depends on your plan. It costs me around 21c on Voda.

We&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d give it a try. Let us know here if you have any problems or questions.

If it works well for you, maybe consider signing up on [LouderVoice][4] and writing some full reviews afterwards.

Our site can index reviews you write on Blogger, WordPress, Typepad, our own [ReviewBlogs][6] site and several others.

p.s. of course you can send your Oxegen reviews to @review as usual but using @oxegen means they are all auto-tagged as they come in so you can find them all in one place.
