LouderVoice was one of the first reviewing apps on Android and was the first ever Irish Android App. It made full use of our powerful API and was a great calling card for our capabilities.

We&#8217;re now thrilled to tell you that our API is being used by another mobile application. This time it&#8217;s the fabulous [Riverdance][1]. If you are a fan of the show, as we are, you are going to want this on your phone. It&#8217;s available for both [iPhone][2] and [Android][3] and has everything you need to enjoy [Riverdance][4] even more.
