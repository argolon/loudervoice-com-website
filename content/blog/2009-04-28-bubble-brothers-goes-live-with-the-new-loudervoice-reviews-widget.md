We&#8217;re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the [Bubble Brothers][1] wine site. Julian, their [Wine 2.0 guru][2], has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-211" title="highfield_bubblebrothers" src="http://www.loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/highfield_bubblebrothers-300x297.jpg" alt="highfield_bubblebrothers" width="300" height="297" />][1]

The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use [Ecommerce Templates][3] for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That&#8217;s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!

All of the reviews submitted on the [Bubble Brothers][4] site will be findable via our [consumer-facing reviews site][5] and via our imminent Google Android mobile application. Relevant reviews written on either of those will also appear on Bubble Brothers.

The widget is the perfect solution for SMEs who want to gain the sales and marketing benefits of customer reviews but who don&#8217;t have the the expertise to implement a custom solution. In the case of Bubble Brothers we replaced the built-in reviews feature which simply doesn&#8217;t provide anything like the benefits of the LouderVoice system. Contact us on business@loudervoice.com if you want to [review-enable your business][6].
