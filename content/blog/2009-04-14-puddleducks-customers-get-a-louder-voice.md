It&#8217;s always a delight to work with like-minded companies so we were doubly pleased when [Puddleducks.ie][1] contacted us recently about using the [LouderVoice][2] customer reviews system on their site.

Puddleducks is a rapidly growing online retailer of outdoor clothing for bothÂ childrenâ€™s and adults. In fact, Â we first encountered them as personal customers of their fantastic products.Â Their range includes Swedish designed dungarees, jackets and trousers for children, as well as waterproof clothing and work wear for adults.

After a very short implementation period, [all of their customers][3] can now read product reviews by previous purchasers and submit their own. Of course, all of those reviews are aggregated to the [LouderVoice][4] reviews website and our soon-to-be-launched mobile phone applications.

[Puddleducks][1] were also deservedly shortlisted today for the 2009 Irish Internet Association Net Visionary Awards as Best Online Trader (why not [give them a vote][5]!). We&#8217;re thrilled to have them on-board as a client and look forward to helping them grow their customer base even faster.
