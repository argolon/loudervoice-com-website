[Web2Ireland.org][1] has arranged a fantastic event in Dublin this coming Thursday. Ten Irish Web start-ups will be presenting their wares to an assembled group of peers, press, Irish Investors, UK Investors, the Future of WebApps conference organisers and other interested parties.

We are thrilled that LouderVoice is one of the ten. If you want to find out more about us, hear about the new features we are launching very soon or would like to discuss investment opportunities (including BES), please head down to Ely HQ on Hanover Quay in Dublin at 6.30pm.
