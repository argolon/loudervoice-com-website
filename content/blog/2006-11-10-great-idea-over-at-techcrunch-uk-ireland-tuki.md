Mike Butcher has [just written about Money Mondays][1] which is a wonderful idea. In his words: 

> Each Monday for a month, starting on Monday 20th November, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll showcase, and publish contact details for, a web or mobile startup which has yet to secure formal funding. They will have to have either an application of their idea up and running (e.g. a live web site) or a working demo or beta we can look at.

I think it is probably too early for us since our non-prettified demo of the prototype will only be ready by the end of the month. Then we are starting closed Alpha testing to figure out what goes in the launched product. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what is showcased on TUKI.
