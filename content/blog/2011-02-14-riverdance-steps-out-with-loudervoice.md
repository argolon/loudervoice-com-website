To describe [Riverdance][1] as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.

The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn&#8217;t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.

Mary O&#8217;Donnell, who heads up their marketing and online teams, describes the new site and our part in it as follows:

> [Riverdance.com][1] is primarily a fan website. One key aspect in the redesign of the site was the opportunity to give the Riverdance Fans the ability to interact with and give their say on all things Riverdance. LouderVoice Reviews are posted in real time thus giving fans the option to voice their views directly and spontaneously. The reviews not only add real and relevant content they also generate fantastic international PR for the show.The integration of Facebook and Twitter into LouderVoice extends this interaction and content beyond [www.riverdance.com][1] and promotes increased communication and sharing of reviews.

Like all our clients, Riverdance will benefit from every extension to our service without having to change anything on the site. Stay tuned for some very exciting Facebook announcements coming soon!
