We&#8217;ve had lots of feedback that our support mechanisms on LouderVoice were weak. Up until today, you could email info@ or leave a comment here on the blog. We know this isn&#8217;t good enough and have decided to make use of [Get Satisfaction][1] to provide a better service in this area.

You&#8217;ll see the Get Satisfaction logo in the sidebar of every page. If you run into any problems at all with the site or find things you don&#8217;t understand, then click on the logo. As time goes by, hopefully you&#8217;ll find a solution or answer already there.

We&#8217;ll add all the known problems with the site in the coming days.
