We were very interested to see an MSNBC article on how hotels are [embracing online customer reviews][1]. It matches our own experience, as our reviewing solutions are proving a major hit with businesses in the hospitality and travel sectors everywhere. We have seen a string of deployments in UK, Ireland, France and the US in recent months.

As part of this growth, we&#8217;re delighted to announce that we have have just gone live with [the Dalata Group&#8217;s][2] 11 Maldron and 14 partner hotels in Ireland.

By providing extremely flexible solutions that have been battle-hardened over several years, hotels and others can benefit from the four pillars of the our platform: SEO, Social Reviews, Customer Feedback and Visitor Confidence. All of these are fully integrated on-site, not via some Third-Party site or clunky pop-up.

Starting with our first hotel back in 2009, we have seen strong growth through our very active partner network including WSI, Avvio, Hotels in One and M3 Social Mindz. The solutions can be provided branded or fully white-labelled according to partner/client needs and are fully localised to French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian.

Enterprise class functionality at an incredibly affordable price means that we have hit the sweet spot for an ever-growing list of clients. In addition to a wide range of individual properties including Hotels and Gastropubs in the UK, Wine Theme Parks in France and Holiday Villas in Spain, we also power the reviews on a variety of holiday and venue sites. Expect to see more news here in the coming weeks.

Finally, we will also be announcing some major US news in the hospitality space in the coming days.
