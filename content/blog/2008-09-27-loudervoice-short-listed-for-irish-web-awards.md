If we were excited to be on the long-list, we&#8217;re utterly gobsmacked to be [shortlisted for best new Web Application/Service][1] in the Irish Web Awards. It&#8217;s not just that we&#8217;re in the shortlist, look at the awesome apps we are in with:

Ã‚Â 

  * [Bookmeetingroom][2] &#8211; I only [wrote about this][3] great app recently on Web2Ireland
  * [PollDaddy][4] &#8211; I use this ALL the time. One of my fave webapps ever.Ã‚Â 
  * [Twitterfone][5] &#8211; Not just dead useful, one of the most beautiful web-site designs of 2008.
  * [Decisions for Heroes][6] &#8211; [Read this][7]. That&#8217;s them that is. Utter brilliance.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â We&#8217;re days away from formally launching LouderVoice for Business. Watch this space.
