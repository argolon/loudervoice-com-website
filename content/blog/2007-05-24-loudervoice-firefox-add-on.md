We&#8217;ve just uploaded the first public release of our [Firefox Add-on][1]. This gives you a pop-up review writing window for Firefox so you can review anything when and where you like without having to go to our site. To make things as easy as possible, we pre-fill the URL and item name fields with those from the page you are currently browsing. If you select some text on that page first, then we&#8217;ll pre-fill the summary with that text too.

So the next time you are reading about something on the web, don&#8217;t just say to yourself, &#8220;dang, I love/hate this&#8221;, write a review there and then!

Try it out and let us know how you get on and what you&#8217;d like to see added. We&#8217;ll be tweaking it in the coming weeks.

You can [find it here][1], along with our browser bookmarklet and WordPress plugin.
