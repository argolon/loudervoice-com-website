Ok ok, so this is niche, very niche, possibly &#8220;HyperLocal&#8221; in Web2 lingo. I just got a mail from Aonghus saying that we got a mention in the Irish language daily newspaper [LÃƒÂ¡][1]. It&#8217;s actually uber-podcaster [Conn Ãƒâ€œ MuÃƒÂ­neachÃƒÂ¡in][2]&#8216;s article about [BarCamp Ireland South East][3] which we attended a few weeks back. There is a only a PDF version right now which will disappear with tomorrow&#8217;s edition. When Conn posts a copy on his blog, I&#8217;ll put up a link to it so you can stretch the old language muscles.

This is the first time in my life I have blockquoted Irish:

> Cuireadh an-suim i dtÃƒÂ¡irge Conor OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill, ÃƒÂ³ nocht sÃƒÂ© don chÃƒÂ©ad uair ag BarCamp cad ÃƒÂ© an saghas gnÃƒÂ³ a bheidh in LouderVoice. SeirbhÃƒÂ­s lÃƒÂ©irmheastÃƒÂ³ireachta atÃƒÂ¡ i gceist, a chuideoidh le blagadÃƒÂ³irÃƒÂ­ a gcÃƒÂ¡il, agus cÃƒÂ¡il a suÃƒÂ­omh, a mhÃƒÂ©adÃƒÂº.

Basically he is saying (forgive my shocking incompetence at Irish, I&#8217;d be dead without this [dictionary][4]) that we publicly revealed for the first time at BarCamp what LouderVoice is all about. It&#8217;s a review web-site that helps build bloggers reputations. Can I just add that &#8220;blagadÃƒÂ³irÃƒÂ­&#8221; is an awesome word for bloggers!

Go raibh maith agat Conn!

UPDATE 1: Text of article now [over at Conn&#8217;s blog][5].
