Last Thursday was a pretty momentous day for LouderVoice. The first code drop was delivered and installed. We have finally moved from talking and speccing to actually having functional code. It is still very very early days and the code just has the bare bones of the required feature set. But even at this stage, the potential is obvious. I was buzzing for days afterwards and I&#8217;m hugely impressed with the progress in a few short weeks.

The next drop will give us something which is genuinely useful despite being &#8220;only&#8221; an alpha of a prototype. One big surprise for us was how non-ugly the system looks already with just a logo and some simple colours. Once we get the alpha, we&#8217;ll be in a position to invite a small set of friendly eyes to try it out and give us &#8220;tough love&#8221; feedback.
