Remember to clearly identify what you are reviewing and give it a score out of 5. We happily accept &#8220;long&#8221; reviews that go beyond 180 characters. You don&#8217;t need to sign up on the site in advance because your first SMS review will do this automatically.

The cost of the SMS should be your normal network rate.

### Web Reviews

Simply go to theÂ [homepage of LouderVoice][20], click on the review writing form there and start typing. When you submit the review, we&#8217;ll automatically create a user account for you and send you a password to your e-mail address.

To make sure your review is entered in the competition, just add the keyword &#8220;therighthook&#8221; (all one word) in the Tags box in the review writing form. You can create as many other tags/categories as you like e.g. phone, mobile, gsm, Nintendo, camera, gadget, electronics etc.

### Winner Notifications

Each weekly winner is decided byÂ [Newstalk Radio][22]. Winners will be contacted by LouderVoice on the mobile number they used to send their first review or by using the email address they submit if they register directly on the site here.
