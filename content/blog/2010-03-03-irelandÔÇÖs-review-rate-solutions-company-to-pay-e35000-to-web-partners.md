We have just launched a new [partner program][1] paying out _substantial commission and bonus payments_ to web professionals, developers and marketers that refer customers.

[LouderVoice][2] is Ireland’s largest and longest standing provider of Review & Rate (R&R) solutions to e-businesses. These solutions give customers the ability to post reviews of a products or services on the website they bought from. R&R tools are seen by market analysts as one of the most important tools for any website serious about online business*.

Our system is delivered using a Software as a Service (SaaS) model which scales effortlessly with a company’s online sales growth. Installation can be as simple as pasting a line of code on a web-page and typically takes less than an hour.

Since 2008, the company has sold direct. _On March 1st, we suspended our direct channel and now only sell through partners_.

We recognise that companies with serious web businesses already have suppliers they trust to manage the ongoing development of their e-business. We now exclusively support these partners in delivering the hottest web tool of the year to their clients.

We offer an extremely rewarding commission and bonus program. _Partners that have 50 customers can earn as much as €7,200 in their first year and larger partners, with 200 customers, can earn over €35,000 within 12 months_. Plus, we pay an ongoing commission for the life of the customer.

Launch Partners include [Webtrade][3], [WSI – Proactive E-Biz][4], [Hotel Consult][5], [Granite Consulting][6], [Digital Crew][7], [Monsoon Consulting][8], [TNS Distribution][9] and [WeddingDates.ie][10].

As our VP of Sales, Karl Llewellyn tells our customers: ‘All serious web business should have a Review & Rate tool on their site, today. They are missing out on sales without it. We provide our partners with all the sales material and support to allow them convert the maximum number of their customers; all they have to do is implement one of our ready-made campaigns.’
