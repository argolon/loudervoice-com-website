[Profilactic][1] has been doing Lifestreaming longer than most.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-119" title="profilactic" src="http://www.loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/profilactic.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="43" />][2]

It&#8217;s a site where you pull in your profiles from all your social sites like Twitter/Jaiku/Pownce/Bebo/MySpace etc so that your aggregated activity online is visible from one place. It currently supports 186 different social sites and we&#8217;re thrilled that they have just added LouderVoice.

Once you&#8217;ve signed up for an account, you just have to provide your LouderVoice username for them to pull in the titles of your reviews into your Profilactic lifestream.

A very nice app with an inspired name ðŸ™‚
