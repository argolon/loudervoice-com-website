We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to [WordPress.org][1]. This means that from now on, when we update it, you&#8217;ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.

Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.

</p>

Apologies to anyone who downloaded it over the past two weeks. We have moved [its location and name][1] on WordPress.org to be more logical. Please delete the recent version and replace with this new one.Â 

If you use WordPress for your blog (not WordPress.com) and you like to write reviews, then we highly recommend you use our plugin. It formats the reviews in an open portable format and makes them easier to index properly. If you don&#8217;t like any aspect of the plugin, feel free to change it, since it is released under the GPL licence.
