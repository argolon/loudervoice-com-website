 ![Irish Blog Awards 2008][1]We&#8217;re really pleased to announce that we are [sponsoring the Best Blog Post award][2] at the 2008 Irish Blog Awards on March 1st in Dublin. Given that so much of [LouderVoice][3] is about bloggers and great review blogposts, it only seemed appropriate.

A big thank you to Damien Mulley for once again organising the awards. The past year has seen the Irish blogosphere becoming more and more visible to a mainstream audience. Let&#8217;s hope we see even more of that in 2008.

Nominations for the Awards close at 9pm this Friday so [get voting][4] and [get blogging][5]. There&#8217;s nothing stopping a post written in the next four days from winning any of the awards!
