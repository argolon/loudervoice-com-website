The third winner in the Three competition on The Right Hook has been announced onÂ [Georgeâ€™s radio show][1]. It is [SarahMc][2]Â from Waterford [who wrote a review][3] of a very interesting device called the Scansound Unilateral Stereo Headphone. This sends both stereo channels into one earpiece for people who are deaf in one ear. Fantastic device and really informative review from Sarah!

One of the prize phones fromÂ [Three][8]Â and Custom-1 headphones fromÂ [Klipsch][9]Â will shortly be on their way to her.

There is only one week left in the competition. So getÂ [writing gadget reviews][10]Â on the site or via SMS! The final winner will be announced next Monday on the show which you can also listen to on the Newstalk web-site.
