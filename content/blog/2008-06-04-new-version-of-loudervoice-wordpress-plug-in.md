Many thanks to Loud Reviewer [Frank Prendergast][1] for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is [available here][2].

You&#8217;ve probably noticed how quiet we&#8217;ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we&#8217;re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We&#8217;ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you&#8217;d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We&#8217;re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.
