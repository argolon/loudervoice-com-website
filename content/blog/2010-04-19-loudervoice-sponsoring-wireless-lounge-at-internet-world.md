As sole sponsors of Â the Wireless Lounge, you&#8217;ll need to talk to us if you want a decent free wifi connection! We&#8217;re on Stand E1060.

Despite the volcano, a massive crowd is expected for the show, as in previous years. Whether you are interested in e-commerce, digital marketing, social media, content management or any aspect of operating online, this is the UK show to attend.

Our lounge is slap bang in the middle of the e-commerce area and we expect to see a lot of you over the three days.

If you have any questions about how our customer reviews solutions can help grow your business, both myself and Karl Llewellyn will be happy to talk to you.

If you&#8217;d like to pre-arrange a meeting, just drop me a line to conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We&#8217;ll arrive Monday (or maybe earlier depending on the Icelandic plumage!) and will be on the ground for the entire show.

Keep an eye out for some InternetWorld-only special offers that we&#8217;ll be running too.

See you there.
