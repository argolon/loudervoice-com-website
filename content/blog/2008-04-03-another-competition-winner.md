We closed the first phase of the reviews competition a few weeks ago but we were so blown away by the review by Alx Cahiz of the [stunning Dervish Longboard][1] that we had to give him a prize.

This wasn&#8217;t just review of the week, I think it was review of the month! Looking forward to seeing what else he comes up with. It should also be said that [TeamGearedUp][2] is one of the best blogs out there about outdoor sports and activities.

We&#8217;ll be kicking off the next phase of the competition very shortly and we&#8217;re totally open to suggestions on the type of prizes.
