[Nice piece by John Collins][1] in The Irish Times Innovation magazine today about the iPhone App Store and Android. Quotes from Conor, [Pat Phelan][2] and [Steve Troughton-Smith][3].

> &#8220;An awful lot of developers had no route to market before the App Store came along,â€ says Conor Oâ€™Neill, software industry veteran and managing director of online review site LouderVoice. He cites the case of Steven Troughton-Smith, a 20-year-old Irish student who has sold thousands of copies of his iPhone applications. In the first six days it was available, Speed, an application that shows how fast youâ€™re travelling, was downloaded 36,000 times. The application was free at that time, but now sells for â‚¬0.79.
> 
> â€œIf someone like that had tried to set up on any other platform, no one would have taken him seriously,â€ says Oâ€™Neill.

In fact, the thing I&#8217;m reminded most of with the App Store is the Home Computer revolution in the early 1980s. Matthew Smith of Manic Miner fame is still one of my heroes. Is iPhone/Android the modern equivalent of C64/ZXSpectrum?
