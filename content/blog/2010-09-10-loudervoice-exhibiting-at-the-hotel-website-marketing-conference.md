Last year&#8217;s [Hotel Website Marketing Conference][1] was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.

Ciar√°n and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn&#8217;t miss it, we&#8217;ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.
