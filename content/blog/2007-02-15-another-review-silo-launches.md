Yawn. [This time it&#8217;s AT&T][1] on their [Yellow Pages][2] site. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if it does affect Yelp and similar sites. I&#8217;m not sure it will.

Will Bob and Marge from Akron Ohio really look up the Yellow Pages and think &#8220;ya know what hun, now that I&#8217;ve found the telephone number of a plumber I must come back later and write a review of how he unblocked our loo&#8221;.

What they do have on their side is scale; even if 0.5% of users write reviews, that&#8217;s a lot of content, so I&#8217;ll be watching closely.
