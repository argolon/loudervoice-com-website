Lots of very interesting headline stats about e-commerce [over on the Econsultancy site][1]. It appears that the prediction of the first online Christmas (50p in the £) by 2015 is well on its way to coming true.

> IMRG predicts that £6.4bn will be spent online in December 2010, up from £5.5bn last year. Total online spending for 2010 is predicted to reach £57,8bn, compared with £49.8bn in 2009.
