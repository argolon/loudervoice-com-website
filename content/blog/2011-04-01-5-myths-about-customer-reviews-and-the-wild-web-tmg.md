The power of Twitter to connect people has proven itself yet again. [Ann Donnelly][1] of [O&#8217;Mahony Donnelly E-Business][2], down the road in Clonakilty, pointed us to an article by [TMG Custom Media][3] in Washington DC. [A few tweets later][4] and we were having an email exchange with Andrew Hanelly in TMG.

The result is a great Q&A over on TMG about the [5 Myths of Customer Reviews][5]. We think it deals with the number one issue that still stops people from adding reviews to their site &#8211; fear.

[The comments have already kicked-off][6] over over on their blog, feel free to contribute.
