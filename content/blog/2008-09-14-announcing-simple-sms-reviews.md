We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.

Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the **_<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>&#8220;Re&#8221;_** and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.

The main things to note are:

  * Simple SMS reviews do not appear immediately. We have to add item and score information when they are received. The delay in publishing is variable from minutes to hours.
  * Remember to include the name of the thing you are reviewing. This might seem obvious but we&#8217;ve forgotten it during testing!
  * Somewhere in the review, mention the score you are giving from 1-5.
  * We still support structured reviews using the &#8220;Review&#8221; keyword.

<div>
  You will also start seeing this service being offered by some of our business clients and partners where each of them will have a different keyword at the beginning of the review.
