Rather than having to go to [LouderVoice][1] to write a review and entering a bunch of information from scratch by hand, we now have a simple button for your browser (both Internet Explorer and Firefox) which makes the process even easier.

If you are browsing any web page that has information about an item you&#8217;d like to review, just click the button. We&#8217;ll give you a review writing screen with the item name and URL pre-populated. Write your review, click the publish button and that review is now on your blog!

Head on over to [our extras page][2] for information on how to put the button in your browser.

Our Firefox plug-in which does this even more slickly is imminent!
