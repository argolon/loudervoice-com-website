      <p>Sometimes it’s the simple features which provide the most value and that’s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.</p>
<h3 id="extra-questions"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></h3>
<p>Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number. But feel free to use the feature in whatever way makes sense for your business. We’d love to hear what you come up with!</p>

      <p>The first thing I do when I land on a site I haven’t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.</p>
<p>We were really excited recently to sign-up <a href="http://www.floradoor.com/">Floradoor</a> in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!</p>
<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

        LouderVoice Launches Dedicated Social Reviews for Facebook
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.</p>
<p>All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but <a href="https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/">this Package</a> enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.</p>
<p>Many of the businesses who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.</p>

It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

      <p>Lots of very interesting headline stats about e-commerce <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/6814-e-commerce-stats-round-up-3?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=topic">over on the Econsultancy site</a>. It appears that the prediction of the first online Christmas (50p in the £) by 2015 is well on its way to coming true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMRG predicts that £6.4bn will be spent online in December 2010, up from £5.5bn last year. Total online spending for 2010 is predicted to reach £57,8bn, compared with £49.8bn in 2009.</p>

      <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing Conference</a> was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">their Facebook Page</a>. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

      <p>Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Ferry to Ireland</a>.

</p>
<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

      <p>We’ve always been impressed with the <a href="http://www.citylocal.co.uk/">Citylocal franchise</a> which was built by Nazir Daud in the UK. Paul Brugger launched <a href="http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork">the Cork site last year</a> and it has been growing at an amazing rate. CityLocal Cork is a Business Directory and community website that provides local information on Businesses, News, Events, Free Ads, Property and Cinema listings.</p>

</p>
<p>Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork">loudervoice.com</a>, on <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx">Google Android</a> mobile phones and shared by users to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice">Facebook</a> and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.</p>

      <p>We had a fantastic time at the second <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/23/facebook-garage-ireland-2/">Irish Facebook Garage</a> in Dublin on Thursday. A packed room of approx 150 people with a wide range of backgrounds heard 5 speakers cover a variety of topics over the space of 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/">Web2Ireland</a> at some point next week.

      <p><a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> was the first reviews company to realise the importance of <a href="http://twitter.com/loudervoice">Twitter</a>. That’s why we’re the people behind <a href="http://twitter.com/review">@review</a> which we launched in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

      <p>We’re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01">Bubble Brothers</a> wine site. Julian, their <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/">Wine 2.0 guru</a>, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.</p>

<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

In the first six days it was available, Speed, an application that shows how fast youâ€™re travelling, was downloaded 36,000 times.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

        Announcing Simple SMS Reviews

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We quietly launched V2 of our <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it’d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by <a href="http://doepud.co.uk/">Doepud</a>) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit. We have also added the ability to follow other reviewers so that all of their activity is visible on your logged-in home page on the site.</p>

On Friday Feb 1st, Bernie Goldbach did a great column focused on mini-reviewing which he <a href="http://www.insideview.ie/irisheyes/2008/02/mini-reviews-on.html">re-posted on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it.

      <p>The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> but takes much less effort.</p>
<p>After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to <a href="http://bifsniff.com/">Frank Prendergast</a> for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:</p>

<p>The idea is simple: Different bloggers propose ideas for themes or topics for each month and one becomes the host for the month. Participating bloggers then buy a wine that is consistent with the theme and blog their tasting notes on or before the Wednesday of the event. All of the opinions are then summarised and linked to on a roundup page.</p>

      <p>This is a little bit of a niche feature but several users have asked for it so we added tagging to mini-reviews on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a>. The idea here is that normally if you send a review by <a href="https://loudervoice.com/sms_help">SMS</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>/<a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>/<a href="http://www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a> then it doesn’t have any user defined category like “wine” or “movie”. However, with “hashtags”, if you add these tags/labels onto your review then we’ll pick them up.</p>
<p>It is very easy to do, just prefix any words you want to use as tags/labels with # in your SMS or on Twitter/Pownce. For technical reasons you have to use a % on Jaiku.</p>

      <p>After getting a lot of user feedback we’ve decided to change the format used in mini-reviews slightly. Whereas before you used fullstop+space to separate the reviewed item from the opinion, we now encourage you to use a colon. This should reduce the number of invalid reviews where the space was left out. Many people also felt that the colon was more logical.</p>
<p>Note that we will continue to support the old format too. Of course the new format means that the review item cannot contain a colon so don’t include http:// if you are reviewing a URL!</p>

      <p>Just a quick note to all our wordpress.com reviewers. Right now you will get an error if you post reviews from LouderVoice to this site. They broke something over the weekend which interferes with remote publishing of blog posts.</p>
<p>We are not the only ones suffering with this, Flock and BlogDesk are too. The basic problem is that whilst the post actually succeeds, the wordpress.com site returns an invalid response when we ask for the URL of the new post. In Flock’s case it just hangs.</p>

<p>What’s LouderVoice all about?</p>
<p>We’ll provide the tools that let you publish reviews to your blog in a specific way. Other users can then find those reviews via our site, read them on your blog and then rate them and do useful things with them. Great reviewers will be able to build their reputations and those looking for great reviews finally have a place where quality bubbles to the top.</p>

      <p>The current version of the WordPress Rich Text Editor causes us “some pain” due to its mangling of things like divs which we use in our microformats markup. We’re interested to know what percentage of WordPress users (both wordpress.com and hosted wordpress.org) actually use it. Here’s a little PollDaddy poll to that end:</p>

        Microformats – empowering your markup for Web 2.0

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>John Allsopp, of the seriously good <a href="http://microformatique.com/">Microformatique</a> site, has just released a book called “<a href="http://www.friendsofed.com/book.html?isbn=1590598148">Microformats – empowering your markup for Web 2.0″</a>. John has been writing on microformats for quite a while now and it is great to see this book emerge. You can get it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598148?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=microformatiq-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1590598148">amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microformats-Empowering-Your-Markup-Web/dp/1590598148/ref=sr_1_1/202-3530205-0135062?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174981925&amp;sr=8-1">.co.uk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this book, noted web developer and long time WaSP member John Allsop teaches all you need to know about the technology: what Microformats are currently available and how to use them; the general principles of how they work, so you’ll be able to understand and use future Microformat; how to use Microformats with web sites and software that already support them; and how to create your own. The focus is kept on practical examples as much as possible throughout.</p>

There are still one or two small glitches to iron out but overall things are very solid. The braver testers can go ahead and try to figure it out for themselves! Otherwise we’ll be sending out the instructions in the coming days.</p>

In the last year we have been avid users of VMWare Server. However it has recently been annoying the hell out of us as it required hacking around to get it running on Fedora Core 6. Bizzarely I could run FC6 inside VMWare on XP but could not get VMWare running on FC6 so I could run FC6 in it!</p>

<p>Well it looks like I was totally wrong and you can configure <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a> or any other Jabber client to receive the messages from those who try to contact you on your blog via the MeeboMe widget.

<p>In terms of functinality, the main focus was on usability and stability. There are not many visible new features there compared to Beta1. The most visible changes are that all actions on results are “in-situ” rather than sending you off to different pages.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re gonna like the changes. Not only that, but those of you who have been wondering what ever happened to your beta invite only have a few more days waiting left to do. We’ll be adding blocks of users each day once we launch. The target is Monday for re-launch but I know that’s being very aggressive so it may be a few days later. I may even launch the new site whilst sitting at a talk in FoWA!</p>

      <p>Andy Sack recently wrote <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2007/02/what_yelp_did_b.html">a superb blog post</a> (and <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2007/02/response_to_my_.html">follow-up</a>) on what <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> did better than <a href="http://www.judysbook.com/">Judy’s Book</a>. I not only admire his honesty and openness but also the clarity of his analysis. Yelp’s focus on a younger demographic and restaurant reviews proved far more fruitful than the wider net and older target audience of Judy’s Book. He also points out that they out-marketed them.</p>
<p>Both Judy’s Book and Yelp are competitors of ours in theory as we are all about reviews (I know this is changing in Judy’s Book) . Therefore I have studied both sites (and many others obviously) and I find Andy’s insights very useful.</p>

As many people know, the SB plug-ins for WordPress and MT were released to a mainly positive response way back in Dec 2005. I made much use of them in the early months and was a big fan from an end-user perspective. Unfortunately, due to lack of further funding they were not able to keep up with WordPress developments.</p>

<p>False reviews are a problem for any review site and are impossible to prevent. However the effect of it can be minimised through the feedback loops of user ratings of reviews. You will naturally gravitate towards those reviews which other users hold in high regard and since that reviewer reputation is an ever changing thing, gaming will always be balanced by well-intentioned users.</p>

      <p>we’re sorry we haven’t been handing out very many over the past few weeks. We’ll be doing a major revamp of the beta site around Feb 16th and then we’ll crank up the invites again and try to get everyone in. There are a sufficient number of annoyances and bugs in the current release that most of you will be happier to wait.</p>
<p>Not only will the site be a lot slicker in two weeks time, it’s going to look fabulous (darling). We think we’ve found all of the major bugs and most of the minor ones at this stage. The main outcome from the first round of testing was what we expected; people hate having to click on too many links to get the information they need and people hate forms! The main improvements in the user experience in the next revision will be in those areas.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Damien for quoting me in The Tribune yesterday. I thought it was an excellent article both on BarCamp and on raising funds. I’d like to explain my quote a little more here. Basically it concerned the Ã¢â€šÂ¬175m the Irish government have given to a set of VCs here. The VCs have to raise matching funds and then start backing businesses here. Many of us have a problem with this idea and my quote was in that context.</p>

<p>Instead of expecting you to spend time and effort writing reviews for us, we’re about your reviews on your blog building your reputation.</p>
<p>We provide the tools that enable you to publish structured reviews to your blog (hReview for the techies out there) and we’ll help everyone else to find your reviews, read them on your blog and then rate them and relate them to reviews by other bloggers. Our job is, above all, to be useful.</p>

      <p>I was excited for a very short period this evening <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/misc/get-your-startup-into-the-spotlight">when I spotted on Ryan Carson’s blog</a> that there was an opportunity for web app startups to get on stage for 10 minutes in front of the entire audience of <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">FOWA</a>. There were only three spots left. I was just about to shoot off an email saying “me me me” when I spotted the final line “The cost is Ã‚Â£5k”.</p>
<p>I’m still stunned. Surely the only start-ups that can afford to spend 5k are the ones who are already funded and who don’t actually need the PR? I was highly critical of LeWeb3 but Loic deserves great credit for the start-up room idea where the cost was a big fat zero. I would never begrudge anyone making a few quid but it seems like the highest cost is being targeted at those least able to afford it.</p>

        Beta1 Test Progress

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The past week has been very educational with the bugs and issues being reported by the Beta Testers. We actually went with Friends and Family, many of whom are non-technical to do the first round of testing. I really wanted to see how they interacted with the site. Whilst we gave instructions on use, they were not overly detailed on purpose. In any case most testers didn’t read them 😉</p>
<p>We were aware of many of the bugs but a few really caught us by surprise and all of them will need to be fixed for Beta2. Some issues we considered low priority to fix turned out to be the opposite for all the users and we need to sort them out asap as it will also reduce the maintenance load on us.</p>

      <p>We’ve been using <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/">WebFaction</a> for all the LouderVoice hosting mainly because they come highly recommended by the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> and Python communities (and donate to the TG project). So far we’ve been very happy with the service, performance and ease of deployment. Their recent launch of an API which allows people to script one-click installs of many applications for use by others has proven to be a very popular move.</p>
<p>They have just given <a href="http://blog.webfaction.com/big-holiday-present">one more reason for using them</a>: They’ve added one long-running process and 40MB of RAM to all plans. Not only that but they’ve doubled the diskspace and quadrupled the bandwidth included in each plan.</p>

      <p>I’m afraid this post is in the same tone as most of the others I’ve read about Le Web 3 – the shark was truly jumped. Did my attendance fee pay for the security for Shimon Peres and the French presidential candidates? Was I at Le Web or Les Grands Buddies de Loic?</p>
<p>Whilst the lack of functioning wifi was deeply annoying for attendees and was a PR disaster for Orange, it was completely unacceptable and frankly amateurish for them not to have dedicated bandwidth for the startup room. The inability of Web-based startups to show their products live at Le Web was laughable and the shrug-attitude of the organisers about this must have been horribly frustrating for those who put all that effort into their preparation.</p>

The TechCrunch coverage lit a little fire underneath us and pushed me to finally get some lovin’ applied to the design of the prototype. We have engaged a superb designer who I met at BarCamp Ireland to just do something quick and simple for next week. The timeline is crazy but his first proposal was absolutely spot-on and we’re running with it. It is a clean, uncluttered, intelligent design to match the *cough*, clean, uncluttered, intelligent application. Now we just have to try and tie everything together for Friday.</p>

      <p>As I’ve said before, we are building our prototype using the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> Web Application framework. <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2006/11/14/turbogears-book-is-out-photographic-evidence-here/">Kevin Dangoor</a> (the leader of the project), Mark Ramm and Gigi Sayfan have just released the first book about this great framework. It is currently the <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2006/11/15/21-tech-book-on-amazoncom/">#20 tech book on Amazon</a>. In addition to the paper copy, a <a href="http://safari.phptr.com/0131583999">Rough Cuts PDF version</a> is available over at Safari Books and this is the version I have been using.</p>
<p>Documentation has always been TG’s biggest weakness and I believe it has hampered its growth. With this book and the current big push by the community to get all the docs in order, that criticism will soon go away. If you are a fan of rapid development for web applications, you should check out <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">turbogears.org</a> and consider purchasing the book.</p>

      <p>I just love buzzwords and acronyms. I’m still deeply disappointed that my Tim Bray derived PECK (People Contributed Experience and Knowledge) as a replacement for UGC never caught on. Now we have an attempt to get Web 3.0 used to describe what’s coming next.</p>
<p>There has been enormous reaction to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">John Markoff’s article</a> in The NYT about Web 3.0 and the “Grand Semantic Web”. As anyone who has read the <a href="http://www.argolon.com/">Argolon</a> blog will know, we belong to the lower-case “upright semantic web” faction. And yes that was a dreadful attempt at a piano metaphor. Of all the commentary, the one I’m most aligned with is <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/there_is_no_web.html">Ross Mayfield’s</a> and in particular his statement</p>

      <p>At the moment I am wrestling with the idea of releasing very early. The prototype will have about 60% of what I view as the “full” functionality. It will have the core features of the service for the individual but will be missing the community features. The current plan is that we get the full drop of the prototype, go through a test and fix phase and then ask in a bunch of friendly faces to try it and and tell us what they think. Part of this would be a discussion on the planned features for the full system to see what made sense to them and what did not. We would then go for the full scalable development for wider release in Q1 followed hopefully by public release later in Q1.</p>

<p>Each Monday for a month, starting on Monday 20th November, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll showcase, and publish contact details for, a web or mobile startup which has yet to secure formal funding.

      <p>When we first kicked off this new venture, I made a few simple decisions on technology. The first was that we were going to take an agile approach with everything and particularly using agile languages and web frameworks. Over the past ten years I’ve had major success with projects which used Tcl, Perl and Python where the accepted wisdom would often have been to build some monster C++ or Java app. Most of those projects were not web related but some of the more recent ones were and the productivity of the developers was often gob-smacking.</p>

      <p>We’ve had LouderVoice.com since the name was decided. BTW feel free to comment on the name, we purposely avoided the current obsession with madey-up nonsense names and went with something descriptive. Since then I’ve added the usual bunch of .org, .net, .co.uk and even .biz because GoDaddy were doing dirt cheap deals.</p>
<p>Of course .ie had to be just that bit more difficult and had to wait until we fulfilled one of the criteria. We achieved this today by successfully registering LOUDERVOICE as a business name with the CRO for Ã¢â€šÂ¬20. I was pleasantly surprised to get notification that we now have loudervoice.ie a few short hours after we purchased it over at Blacknight.</p>
