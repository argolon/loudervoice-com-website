      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common requests we get from partners and customers is to have the same reviews SEO functionality on ASP.NET as they do for PHP and WordPress sites. And we’re delighted to say that this is now available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of our Packages provide Google Juice and Star Ratings in Search results to client sites via our review Hub, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.louderyou.com/&#34;&gt;LouderYou&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of this approach is ease of deployment. Our code can be added in seconds to a web-page and reviews are then live. Those reviews are indexed on our hub within hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt; was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760&#34; title=&#34;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;507&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg 724w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03-300x62.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Citylocal Cork Reviews on LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve always been impressed with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Citylocal franchise&lt;/a&gt; which was built by Nazir Daud in the UK. Paul Brugger launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork&#34;&gt;the Cork site last year&lt;/a&gt; and it has been growing at an amazing rate. CityLocal Cork is a Business Directory and community website that provides local information on Businesses, News, Events, Free Ads, Property and Cinema listings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.ie/cork&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Citylocal Cork&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/10/citylocal-cork-reviews-on-loudervoice/city-logo-anim.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;75&#34; height=&#34;75&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork&#34;&gt;loudervoice.com&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx&#34;&gt;Google Android&lt;/a&gt; mobile phones and shared by users to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
