      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve spent the past few months in LouderVoice creating Version 2 of our review widget and have been quietly rolling it out on sites since early August.

Not only can it be implemented on most sites in under 10 minutes, it is also fully Facebook and Twitter enabled and can be easily styled to blend seamlessly into your site</description>
