      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
