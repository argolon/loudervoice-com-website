      <description>If you have any interest in Cloud Computing then you should be attending next week&amp;#8217;s Cloud Computing Summit in Croke Park in Dublin.
The line-up of speakers is fantastic and the topics very relevant to businesses of any size. LouderVoice CEO, Conor, will be on a user panel speaking about our experiences of moving all the LouderVoice services to Amazon AWS. That includes S3, EC2, EBS, EIP, Cloudfront and only excludes ELB since it hasn&amp;#8217;t launched in Europe yet.</description>
