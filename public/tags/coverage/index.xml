      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to get two pieces on LouderVoice in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.examiner.ie/&#34;&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/a&gt; newspaper recently. On Friday Feb 1st, Bernie Goldbach did a great column focused on mini-reviewing which he &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insideview.ie/irisheyes/2008/02/mini-reviews-on.html&#34;&gt;re-posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it. Apologies for the roughness of the scan and for not OCRing it. The photograph is by Denis Minihane.
