      <description>Wow.
Jolie O&amp;#8217;Dell just did the Top Ten International Web Products of 2009 on the always brilliant ReadWriteWeb.
We didn&amp;#8217;t make the Top Ten yet but that&amp;#8217;s OK, we&amp;#8217;ll be there in 2010 ðŸ™‚
What we did make was the Honourable Mentions list!
The only Irish web company to do so.
The Golden Spiders award was national recognition for what we&amp;#8217;ve been doing this year and now this is global.</description>
