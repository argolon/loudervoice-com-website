      <description>I had the pleasure of being interviewed recently for the leading French Business Magazine, Stratégies. It was about doing business in Ireland and some of the positive aspects of setting up here despite the recession.
You&amp;#8217;ll need pretty fluent French to read the entire article but there are some good nuggets in there.
Enjoy!
