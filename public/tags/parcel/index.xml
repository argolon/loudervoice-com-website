      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Parcel2Ship&lt;/a&gt; which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Parcel2Ship&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
