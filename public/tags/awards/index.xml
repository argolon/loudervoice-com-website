 LouderVoice is listed in the &amp;#8220;Best Business or Enterprise Startup 2010&amp;#8221; Category. If you think we deserve the award, why not head over to the site and cast your vote.</description>

      <description>We were terribly disappointed last Thursday that massive flooding in West Cork prevented us from attending the 2009 Golden Spiders Awards. The awards are the most high profile in Ireland and a win can have serious business benefits locally.
So imagine our shock to hear that we won the e-business category! We were up against some incredibly impressive competition. Getting this recognition from our industry peers on the judging panel really is satisfying.</description>

      <description>What a fantastic couple of weeks in the life of LouderVoice. Yesterday we found out we&amp;#8217;ve been shortlisted for New Company of The Year by The Irish Software Association. This is one helluva heavy-duty event and we&amp;#8217;re nervous about the interview process already.

There willÂ be lots more announcements and coverage in the next two weeks so watch closely.</description>
