      <description>It&amp;#8217;s always a delight to work with like-minded companies so we were doubly pleased when Puddleducks.ie contacted us recently about using the LouderVoice customer reviews system on their site.
 Puddleducks is a rapidly growing online retailer of outdoor clothing for bothÂ childrenâ€™s and adults. In fact, Â we first encountered them as personal customers of their fantastic products.Â Their range includes Swedish designed dungarees, jackets and trousers for children, as well as waterproof clothing and work wear for adults.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had a fantastic year in LouderVoice and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:
 In January we launched Flag Tag reviewing which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post. We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the Irish Blog Awards In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</description>
