      <description>Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s the simple features which provide the most value and that&amp;#8217;s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.
Extra Questions Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number.</description>

      <description>The first thing I do when I land on a site I haven&amp;#8217;t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.
We were really excited recently to sign-up Floradoor in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.</description>

      <description>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!
This is simply a superb idea by l&amp;#8217;Auberge des Trois Pucelles near Grenoble and our partners Thierry André FOUCHER and WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies.</description>

      <description>We were very interested to see an MSNBC article on how hotels are embracing online customer reviews. It matches our own experience, as our reviewing solutions are proving a major hit with businesses in the hospitality and travel sectors everywhere. We have seen a string of deployments in UK, Ireland, France and the US in recent months.
As part of this growth, we&amp;#8217;re delighted to announce that we have have just gone live with the Dalata Group&amp;#8217;s 11 Maldron and 14 partner hotels in Ireland.</description>

      <description>Nielsen’s latest Global Trust in Advertising report, which surveyed more than 28,000 Internet respondents in 56 countries, shows that 92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family, followed closely by 70% trusting online reviews.
Here are the highlight stats. Read the great piece about it over on Social Commerce Today.

We&amp;#8217;ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we&amp;#8217;re not remotely surprised by this data.</description>

      <description>More and more sites are moving to WordPress as their platform. We have long been WP users and all of our sites are built on it.
The LouderVoice reviews system has always supported WordPress sites but we recently decided to make it even easier to deploy on them.
 The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.</description>

      <description>Due to ongoing strong demand both in France and Canada, LouderVoice is now available fully localised to French.
 As with Spanish and Russian, this includes both the entire end-user experience and the review management back-end for businesses.
Of course all of our powerful Social integrations work seamlessly in French too and provide the full 360 degree view from reviews on a businesses site to reviews on Facebook and back again.</description>

      <description>Our development team have been hard at work this summer building a ton of new features for LouderVoice. The first fruits of their labour is the full front-end and back-end localisation of the service. We&amp;#8217;ve always been internationalised but now our clients and their customers can use every part of LouderVoice in their own native language.

The first two languages that are available right now are Spanish and Russian with French coming soon.</description>

      <description>The power of Twitter to connect people has proven itself yet again. Ann Donnelly of O&amp;#8217;Mahony Donnelly E-Business, down the road in Clonakilty, pointed us to an article by TMG Custom Media in Washington DC. A few tweets later and we were having an email exchange with Andrew Hanelly in TMG.
The result is a great Q&amp;amp;A over on TMG about the 5 Myths of Customer Reviews. We think it deals with the number one issue that still stops people from adding reviews to their site &amp;#8211; fear.</description>

      <description>The IIA is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called &amp;#8220;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&amp;#8220;, it&amp;#8217;s all about selling online and multi-channel.
The focus this time is &amp;#8220;Content and Analysis&amp;#8221; and therefore it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we&amp;#8217;ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</description>

      <description>To describe Riverdance as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.
 The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn&amp;#8217;t have been more excited.</description>

      <description>Lots of very interesting headline stats about e-commerce over on the Econsultancy site. It appears that the prediction of the first online Christmas (50p in the £) by 2015 is well on its way to coming true.
 IMRG predicts that £6.4bn will be spent online in December 2010, up from £5.5bn last year. Total online spending for 2010 is predicted to reach £57,8bn, compared with £49.8bn in 2009.

      <description>Last year&amp;#8217;s Hotel Website Marketing Conference was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.
 Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn&amp;#8217;t miss it, we&amp;#8217;ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat.</description>

      <description>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated &amp;#8220;Our Reviews&amp;#8221; tab on their Facebook Page. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.
Now a simple review written on a client&amp;#8217;s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business.</description>

They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.
 If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May!</description>

What we did make was the Honourable Mentions list!
The only Irish web company to do so.

      <description>LouderVoice was the first reviews company to realise the importance of Twitter. That&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re the people behind @review which we launched in June 2007.
Since then we&amp;#8217;ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.
Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening we uploaded the first public beta of our Google Android mobile application to the Android Market.
This is the first Irish Android application and one of the very first reviewing applications on the platform.
You&amp;#8217;ll have to patiently wait for the launches of the HTC Magic and Samsung I7500 before Â most Irish people can try it out. Anyone living in countries where Android is already live can install it now.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the Bubble Brothers wine site. Julian, their Wine 2.0 guru, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.

The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use Ecommerce Templates for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running.</description>

      <description>The LouderVoice customer reviews service is getting a lot of attention from businesses who are looking for ways to retain customers and grow sales in these difficult times.
So the latest research from Avail Intellingence comes as no surprise to us. InternetRetailing reports that the research shows over a third (36%) of respondents rated peer opinions such as recommendations, reviews and customer generated wish lists as the most useful aspect of an Internet-shopping site.</description>

      <description>We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to WordPress.org. This means that from now on, when we update it, you&amp;#8217;ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.
Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had a fantastic year in LouderVoice and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:
 In January we launched Flag Tag reviewing which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post. We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the Irish Blog Awards In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</description>

      <description>We are incredibly happy to announce that Klipsch has just launched its UK specific site. Not only are they selling amazing audio equipment but the reviews there are powered by LouderVoice.
When you are investing Â£1000 in a sub-woofer, you want to be sure you are picking the right one. Reviews by other customers can help you make that decision. The Klipsch guys understand that those reviews are a win-win for everyone.</description>

      <title>Announcing Simple SMS Reviews</title>

      <guid>https://www.loudervoice.com/blog/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/</guid>
      <description>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.
Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the keyword &amp;#8220;Re&amp;#8221; and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</description>

As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There&amp;#8217;ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews.</description>

We&amp;#8217;re partnering with several of the exhibitors including Ummera and Bubble Brothers to encourage those who attend to review both the event and the individual stands. Reviews can be submitted by any of the usual methods but SMS seems the most appropriate.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a site where you pull in your profiles from all your social sites like Twitter/Jaiku/Pownce/Bebo/MySpace etc so that your aggregated activity online is visible from one place. It currently supports 186 different social sites and we&amp;#8217;re thrilled that they have just added LouderVoice.
Once you&amp;#8217;ve signed up for an account, you just have to provide your LouderVoice username for them to pull in the titles of your reviews into your Profilactic lifestream.</description>

      <description>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer Frank Prendergast for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is available here.
You&amp;#8217;ve probably noticed how quiet we&amp;#8217;ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we&amp;#8217;re been working hard on building our API.</description>

This wasn&amp;#8217;t just review of the week, I think it was review of the month! Looking forward to seeing what else he comes up with. It should also be said that TeamGearedUp is one of the best blogs out there about outdoor sports and activities.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been promising it forever and now we&amp;#8217;re finally ready to unveil the all-new LouderVoice WordPress plug-in V2.0. This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.
The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from Robin Blandford.</description>

      <description>We quietly launched V2 of our LouderVoice on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it&amp;#8217;d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.
The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site.</description>

Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it. Apologies for the roughness of the scan and for not OCRing it.</description>

      <description>The fourth week of the competition (and final week of this phase) is over and we can now announce the winner of a Hairy Baby t-shirt.
Congratulations to CiarÃƒÂ¡n Rooney, an Irish guy living in London, who wins with his complimentary review of AerLingus.com phone customer support. The review, which he wrote on Jaiku, currently tops Google for &amp;#8220;Aer Lingus Support&amp;#8221;.
