      <description>We really are jumping up and down with excitement to finally announce that LouderVoice&amp;#8217;s first US client went live just before Le Web recently.Â Klipsch USA now has the LouderVoice customer review system across the entire klipsch.com web-site.
 For those in Europe not familiar with this legendary US brand, it had defined high-end audio since 1946 and is adored by audiophiles everywhere.
 Building on over 60 years of experience in hifi equipment, they also have the absolute best headphones and docks anywhere for iPhones, iPods and other MP3 players.</description>
