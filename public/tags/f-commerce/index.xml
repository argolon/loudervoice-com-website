      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/&#34;&gt;this Package&lt;/a&gt; enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the businesses who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
