      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have updated our &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/privacy-policy/&#34;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; to include GDPR provisions. This includes information on how to request that your personal information be deleted from our systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, anyone submitting reviews using our solution on our clients&amp;rsquo; sites must now actively provide their consent that their name and email address can be shared with LouderVoice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New features help you to connect better with your customers using reviews</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s the simple features which provide the most value and that’s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;extra-questions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number. But feel free to use the feature in whatever way makes sense for your business. We’d love to hear what you come up with!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>French restaurant delights with live LouderVoice customer reviews on iPad</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/11/06/french-restaurant-delights-with-live-loudervoice-customer-reviews-on-ipad/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is simply a superb idea by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/&#34;&gt;l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles&lt;/a&gt; near Grenoble and our partners &lt;a href=&#34;http://wsiclarinet.com/&#34;&gt;Thierry André FOUCHER&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsibds.com/&#34;&gt;WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies&lt;/a&gt;. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557&#34;&gt;Facebook Page too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were very interested to see an MSNBC article on how hotels are &lt;a href=&#34;http://travelkit.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/22/12188135-how-hotels-are-embracing-online-customer-reviews?lite&#34;&gt;embracing online customer reviews&lt;/a&gt;. It matches our own experience, as our reviewing solutions are proving a major hit with businesses in the hospitality and travel sectors everywhere. We have seen a string of deployments in UK, Ireland, France and the US in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of this growth, we’re delighted to announce that we have have just gone live with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dalatahotelgroup.com/&#34;&gt;the Dalata Group’s&lt;/a&gt; 11 Maldron and 14 partner hotels in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LouderVoice and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.totalwsinetsolutions.com/&#34;&gt;WSI&lt;/a&gt; have been working together globally since early 2011.

      <title>LouderVoice Reviews SEO Add-On for ASP.NET just released</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/05/10/loudervoice-reviews-seo-add-on-for-asp-net-just-released/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/05/10/loudervoice-reviews-seo-add-on-for-asp-net-just-released/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common requests we get from partners and customers is to have the same reviews SEO functionality on ASP.NET as they do for PHP and WordPress sites. And we’re delighted to say that this is now available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of our Packages provide Google Juice and Star Ratings in Search results to client sites via our review Hub, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.louderyou.com/&#34;&gt;LouderYou&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of this approach is ease of deployment. Our code can be added in seconds to a web-page and reviews are then live. Those reviews are indexed on our hub within hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Word of Mouth Still Most Trusted Resource Says Nielsen</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/04/16/word-of-mouth-still-most-trusted-resource-says-nielsen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nielsen’s latest Global Trust in Advertising report, which surveyed more than 28,000 Internet respondents in 56 countries, shows that 92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family, followed closely by 70% trusting online reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the highlight stats. Read the great piece about it over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://socialcommercetoday.com/word-of-mouth-still-most-trusted-resource-says-nielsen-implications-for-social-commerce/&#34;&gt;Social Commerce Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2605 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;trust-in-advertising&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;570&#34; height=&#34;486&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png 570w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising-300x255.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to ongoing strong demand both in France and Canada, LouderVoice is now available fully localised to French.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/guysavoy.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2375&#34; title=&#34;guysavoy&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/guysavoy.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;541&#34; height=&#34;542&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/guysavoy.png 676w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/guysavoy-150x150.png 150w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/guysavoy-300x300.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with Spanish and Russian, this includes both the entire end-user experience and the review management back-end for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course all of our powerful Social integrations work seamlessly in French too and provide the full 360 degree view from reviews on a businesses site to reviews on Facebook and back again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why a negative review may not be so bad after all</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2011/06/12/why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-so-bad-after-all/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2011/06/12/why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-so-bad-after-all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a great piece over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/7622-why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-negative-at-all&#34;&gt;Econsultancy about negative reviews&lt;/a&gt;. Well worth a read. It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The power of Twitter to connect people has proven itself yet again. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ann_donnelly&#34;&gt;Ann Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-business.ie/&#34;&gt;O’Mahony Donnelly E-Business&lt;/a&gt;, down the road in Clonakilty, pointed us to an article by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmgcustommedia.com/&#34;&gt;TMG Custom Media&lt;/a&gt; in Washington DC. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/TMGmedia&#34;&gt;A few tweets later&lt;/a&gt; and we were having an email exchange with Andrew Hanelly in TMG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is a great Q&amp;amp;A over on TMG about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://engage.tmgcustommedia.com/2011/03/5-myths-about-customer-reviews-and-the-wild-web/&#34;&gt;5 Myths of Customer Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. We think it deals with the number one issue that still stops people from adding reviews to their site – fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To describe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com&#34;&gt;Riverdance&lt;/a&gt; as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com/the-show/fan-reviews/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1906  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Riverdance Reviews&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;83&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png 550w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post-300x45.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt; was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760&#34; title=&#34;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;507&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg 724w, http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03-300x62.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LouderVoice Reviews on Facebook Pages</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2010/08/27/loudervoice-reviews-on-facebook-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2010 09:01:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2010/08/27/loudervoice-reviews-on-facebook-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=ts&#34;&gt;their Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html&#34;&gt;over on Search Engine People&lt;/a&gt;. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few of their gems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt; of online consumers &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, &lt;strong&gt;8% trust celebrities&lt;/strong&gt; (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70%&lt;/strong&gt; consult reviews or ratings &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; purchasing&lt;/strong&gt; (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 in 10&lt;/strong&gt; who read reviews &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; them with friends, family &amp;amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45%&lt;/strong&gt; say they are &lt;strong&gt;influenced&lt;/strong&gt; a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.)

      <title>Fastnet Line Cork-Swansea Ferry on-board with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Ferry to Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. This much needed service operating from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Swansea to Cork&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be a major success for the region. So you can imagine our excitement at LouderVoice becoming part of this story by powering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;customer reviews on their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1743  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fastnet Line&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/06/fastnet-line-cork-swansea-ferry-on-board-with-loudervoice/logo2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;266&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;response from travellers&lt;/a&gt; has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Parcel2Ship&lt;/a&gt; which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Parcel2Ship&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
