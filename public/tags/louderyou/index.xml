      <description>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is &amp;#8220;all of them&amp;#8221;! LouderVoiceÂ recently went live with a UK site called Parcel2Ship which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.
 If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May!</description>
