      <description>We should have posted this before Christmas but the finalÂ winner in the Three competition was Gabriel Kelly from Carrigaline in Cork for her review of theÂ Philips DCP951/05.
Â Â Â Â Â One of the prize phones fromÂ ThreeÂ and Custom-1 headphones fromÂ KlipschÂ are already on their way to her.
Well done to all the winners and thanks again to George Hook for making this all happen.</description>
