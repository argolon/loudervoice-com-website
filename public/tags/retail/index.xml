      <description>My talk on customer reviews at the IIA&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&amp;#8221; event seemed to go down very well.
Judge for yourself. Hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll find it useful.</description>

      <description>The IIA is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called &amp;#8220;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&amp;#8220;, it&amp;#8217;s all about selling online and multi-channel.
The focus this time is &amp;#8220;Content and Analysis&amp;#8221; and therefore it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we&amp;#8217;ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</description>
