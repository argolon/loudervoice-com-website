      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve had lots of feedback that our support mechanisms on LouderVoice were weak. Up until today, you could email info@ or leave a comment here on the blog. We know this isn’t good enough and have decided to make use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice&#34;&gt;Get Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; to provide a better service in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see the Get Satisfaction logo in the sidebar of every page. If you run into any problems at all with the site or find things you don’t understand, then click on the logo. As time goes by, hopefully you’ll find a solution or answer already there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
