      <p>The first thing I do when I land on a site I haven’t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.</p>
<p>We were really excited recently to sign-up <a href="http://www.floradoor.com/">Floradoor</a> in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.</p>

      <p>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!</p>
<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

      <p>As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.</p>
<p>All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but <a href="https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/">this Package</a> enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.</p>
<p>Many of the businesses who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.</p>

It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.iia.ie/">IIA</a> is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “<a href="http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/">8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff</a>“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.</p>
<p>The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>To describe <a href="http://www.riverdance.com">Riverdance</a> as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.</p>

</p>
<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers.

<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

<p>There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/">Web2Ireland</a> at some point next week.

      <p><a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> was the first reviews company to realise the importance of <a href="http://twitter.com/loudervoice">Twitter</a>. That’s why we’re the people behind <a href="http://twitter.com/review">@review</a> which we launched in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

Julian, their <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/">Wine 2.0 guru</a>, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.</p>

<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

        What is LouderVoice V2 all about?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We quietly launched V2 of our <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it’d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by <a href="http://doepud.co.uk/">Doepud</a>) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit. We have also added the ability to follow other reviewers so that all of their activity is visible on your logged-in home page on the site.</p>

        Easy Blog Reviews with Flag Tags

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> but takes much less effort.</p>
<p>After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to <a href="http://bifsniff.com/">Frank Prendergast</a> for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:</p>
