<p>There has been enormous reaction to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">John Markoff’s article</a> in The NYT about Web 3.0 and the “Grand Semantic Web”.

<blockquote>
<p>I’d bet the future is less the Matrix than Soylent Green. Less semantic fuzz than social discovery. Less artificial intelligence than human intelligence. Less automation and more augmentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Add that to Tim O’Reilly’s <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/11/harnessing_coll.html">Harnessing Collective Intelligence</a> and you have the basis for a slew of new and useful services that work with current behaviours, nudge them forward and make use of <a href="http://microformats.org/">appropriately structured</a> distributed content. This is a critical stepping stone in warming up that ocean before the promoters of grander schemes have any hope of succeeding with their vision.</p>
<p>Call it whatever you want, the labels mean nothing, it is all in the delivery.</p>
