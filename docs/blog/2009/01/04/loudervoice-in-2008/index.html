    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="We’ve had a fantastic year in LouderVoice and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:

In January we launched Flag Tag reviewing which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.
We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support
In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the Irish Blog Awards
In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.
We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)
We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering
In July we started using Get Satisfaction for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.
In September we launched Simple SMS reviews requiring just a single keyword
We were also Shortlisted in the Irish Web Awards
In October we launched LouderVoice for Business to great attention
We were also shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards
And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors
In November, our first B2B client, Klipsch, went live
In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009
