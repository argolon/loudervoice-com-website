The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.">

Called “<a href="http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/">8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff</a>“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.</p>
