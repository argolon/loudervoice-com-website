All you have to do is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the <a href="http://twitter.com/oxegen">the oxegen user</a> as a friend on Twitter. You’ll be added back within a few minutes.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/devices">make sure your mobile number is registered</a> with them</li>
<li>Start sending your reviews by SMS to +447624801423 in the following format:</li>
<li>@oxegen 5 Queens of the Stone Age. Greatest band on the planet. Live set blew my mind</li>
<li>So the format is: @oxegen RatingOutOf5 Thing. ReviewText</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>The first fullstop+space between the thing you are reviewing and the review is important so we know which is which.</p>
<p>Within 30 minutes that review will be searchable/rateable/bookmarkable/shareable on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a>.</p>
<p>All of the Oxegen mini-reviews (whether via Twitter or Jaiku) will be visible <a href="https://loudervoice.com/tags/oxegen">here on LouderVoice</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a premium SMS number so the cost of sending texts just depends on your plan. It costs me around 21c on Voda.</p>
<p>We’d love it if you’d give it a try. Let us know here if you have any problems or questions.</p>
<p>If it works well for you, maybe consider signing up on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and writing some full reviews afterwards.</p>
<p>Our site can index reviews you write on Blogger, WordPress, Typepad, our own <a href="http://reviewblogs.loudervoice.com/">ReviewBlogs</a> site and several others.</p>
<p>p.s. of course you can send your Oxegen reviews to @review as usual but using @oxegen means they are all auto-tagged as they come in so you can find them all in one place.</p>
