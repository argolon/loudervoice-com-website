    <meta name="description" content="We’re doing a ton of changes over the next few days in preparation for the Beta2 launch. You’ll see all of the current sites appear and disappear at random. Please be patient with us. The main tasks are to move from a shared host to a VPS and to start using www for everything instead of beta.
I’m sure you’re gonna like the changes. Not only that, but those of you who have been wondering what ever happened to your beta invite only have a few more days waiting left to do. We’ll be adding blocks of users each day once we launch. The target is Monday for re-launch but I know that’s being very aggressive so it may be a few days later. I may even launch the new site whilst sitting at a talk in FoWA!">
