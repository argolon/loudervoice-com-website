<p>This is the first time in my life I have blockquoted Irish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cuireadh an-suim i dtÃƒÂ¡irge Conor OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill, ÃƒÂ³ nocht sÃƒÂ© don chÃƒÂ©ad uair ag BarCamp cad ÃƒÂ© an saghas gnÃƒÂ³ a bheidh in LouderVoice. SeirbhÃƒÂ­s lÃƒÂ©irmheastÃƒÂ³ireachta atÃƒÂ¡ i gceist, a chuideoidh le blagadÃƒÂ³irÃƒÂ­ a gcÃƒÂ¡il, agus cÃƒÂ¡il a suÃƒÂ­omh, a mhÃƒÂ©adÃƒÂº.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically he is saying (forgive my shocking incompetence at Irish, I’d be dead without this <a href="http://www.englishirishdictionary.com/dictionary">dictionary</a>) that we publicly revealed for the first time at BarCamp what LouderVoice is all about. It’s a review web-site that helps build bloggers reputations. Can I just add that “blagadÃƒÂ³irÃƒÂ­” is an awesome word for bloggers!</p>
<p>Go raibh maith agat Conn!</p>
