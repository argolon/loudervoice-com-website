I not only admire his honesty and openness but also the clarity of his analysis.

<p>Both Judy‚Äôs Book and Yelp are competitors of ours in theory as we are all about reviews (I know this is changing in Judy‚Äôs Book) . Therefore I have studied both sites (and many others obviously) and I find Andy‚Äôs insights very useful.</p>
<p>As our site is built entirely around the idea of publishing reviews to and aggregating reviews from blogs, we will be a reflection of what our users are focused on already.√É‚Äö√Ç¬† Of course we have our plans for the direction of the site but√É‚Äö√Ç¬† rather than force it initially, we are using this pre-launch time to monitor the areas that users are blogging about and see how best to match that to what people are seeking. We‚Äôve already been surprised by some of the areas of activity and luckily from a business perspective they also make sense for us. The blogging aspect obviously gives us a younger demographic by default.</p>
<p>I should point out that I‚Äôve never been convinced that hyperlocal ‚ÄúUser Generated Content‚Äù businesses based on closed data-silos can scale. The amount of investment that Yelp have required to just operate in a small set of US cities says a lot. Looking at the change of direction for Judy‚Äôs Book and what happened at InsiderPages just confirms that belief.</p>
<p>To me, the ultimate in Local is the individual‚Äôs blog reflecting the views, opinions and knowledge of that individual in a real community. If individual bloggers cluster together around areas of mutual interest on our site then Local is whatever they define it to be; restaurants in Boise, theatres in Cork, forest walks in Finland.</p>
<p>As with any business, the two challenges for us are marketing ourselves effectively and being able to generate revenue based on user activity and intention. I just don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be doing down the Yelp party route somehow üòâ</p>
