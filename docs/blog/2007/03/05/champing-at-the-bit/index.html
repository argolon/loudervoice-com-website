<ul>
<li>Movable Type – Fully functional, may do some style tweaks</li>
<li>Typepad – Fully functional, may do some style tweaks</li>
<li>Live Journal – One outstanding bug</li>
<li>WordPress.com – Testing almost complete, appears to be fully functional</li>
<li>Hosted WordPress – Ditto</li>
<li>WPMU – Ditto</li>
<li>Blogspot/Blogger- Under development. Won’t be available until full launch</li>
<li>Windows Live Spaces – they break the markup but they have said they are working on that</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we’ve added more robustness, we’ll be allowing all the beta testers to switch over to their own blogs. We’ll let you know asap.</p>
