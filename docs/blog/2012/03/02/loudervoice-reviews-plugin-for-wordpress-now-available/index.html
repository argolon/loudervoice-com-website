<p>The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.</p>
<p>You need no technical experience to install and setup the plugin.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>It really is that easy</strong></em></span>!</p>
<p>Here is how you add reviews to any page on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/page.png"><img class="wp-image-2639 aligncenter" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="page" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/page.png" alt="" width="565" height="260" /></a>
</p>
<p>In addition to being simple to install, it provides a major SEO benefit by making the reviews directly indexable by Google so that they can appear as star ratings in Search results.</p>
<p>It can generate code for English, Spanish, Italian and French sites. The admin screens themselves will be localised soon. Of course it is fully WP multi-site compatible.</p>
