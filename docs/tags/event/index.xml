      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in Cloud Computing then you should be attending next week’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudsummit.ie/&#34;&gt;Cloud Computing Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Croke Park in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The line-up of speakers is fantastic and the topics very relevant to businesses of any size. &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; CEO, Conor, will be on a user panel speaking about our experiences of moving all the LouderVoice services to Amazon AWS. That includes S3, EC2, EBS, EIP, Cloudfront and only excludes ELB since it hasn’t launched in Europe yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
