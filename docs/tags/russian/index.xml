      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our development team have been hard at work this summer building a ton of new features for LouderVoice. The first fruits of their labour is the full front-end and back-end localisation of the service. We’ve always been internationalised but now our clients and their customers can use every part of LouderVoice in their own native language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/spanish2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2310&#34; title=&#34;spanish2&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/spanish2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;504&#34; height=&#34;542&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/spanish2.png 504w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/spanish2-278x300.png 278w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first two languages that are available right now are Spanish and Russian with French coming soon.
