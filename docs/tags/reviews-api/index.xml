      <description>This is the kind of news we love to get on a sunny Monday morning in West Cork. We have been shortlisted in the Innovation Category of the Irish Internet Association Net Visionary Awards. If you think we deserve the award then why not head over and vote? Don&amp;#8217;t forget all the other categories too, lots of fantastic companies and people in there.
