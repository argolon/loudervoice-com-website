      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more sites are moving to &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; as their platform. We have long been WP users and all of our sites are built on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The LouderVoice reviews system has always supported WordPress sites but we recently decided to make it even easier to deploy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/blue-l.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2676 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;blue-l&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/blue-l.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Ferry to Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. This much needed service operating from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Swansea to Cork&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be a major success for the region. So you can imagine our excitement at LouderVoice becoming part of this story by powering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;customer reviews on their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1743  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fastnet Line&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/06/fastnet-line-cork-swansea-ferry-on-board-with-loudervoice/logo2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;266&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;response from travellers&lt;/a&gt; has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
