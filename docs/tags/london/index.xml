      <description>The Internet World show is on in Earl&amp;#8217;s Court, London, from April 27th to 29th and LouderVoice will be there in force.
 As sole sponsors of the Wireless Lounge, you&amp;#8217;ll need to talk to us if you want a decent free wifi connection! We&amp;#8217;re on Stand E1060.
Despite the volcano, a massive crowd is expected for the show, as in previous years. Whether you are interested in e-commerce, digital marketing, social media, content management or any aspect of operating online, this is the UK show to attend.</description>
