      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=ts&#34;&gt;their Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a fantastic time at the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/23/facebook-garage-ireland-2/&#34;&gt;Irish Facebook Garage&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin on Thursday. A packed room of approx 150 people with a wide range of backgrounds heard 5 speakers cover a variety of topics over the space of 2.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/&#34;&gt;Web2Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at some point next week. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of Conor’s live demo of the LouderVoice reviews widget + Facebook Connect in action. This widget will be formally launched in the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
