      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had lots of feedback that our support mechanisms on LouderVoice were weak. Up until today, you could email info@ or leave a comment here on the blog. We know this isn&amp;#8217;t good enough and have decided to make use of Get Satisfaction to provide a better service in this area.
You&amp;#8217;ll see the Get Satisfaction logo in the sidebar of every page. If you run into any problems at all with the site or find things you don&amp;#8217;t understand, then click on the logo.</description>
