      <description>Well done to all the winners at the Irish Blog Awards on Saturday. A wonderful night was had by everyone and our only disappointment was that we didn&amp;#8217;t get to meet Fatmammycat who won in the LouderVoice-sponsored Best Blog Post category with her incredibly moving post on fox hunting.
The success of the awards every year is down to one man, Damien Mulley. Thanks again for another memorable night.
Here is the full list of winners:</description>
