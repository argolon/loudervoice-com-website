      <description>The fourth week of the competition (and final week of this phase) is over and we can now announce the winner of a Hairy Baby t-shirt.
Congratulations to CiarÃƒÂ¡n Rooney, an Irish guy living in London, who wins with his complimentary review of AerLingus.com phone customer support. The review, which he wrote on Jaiku, currently tops Google for &amp;#8220;Aer Lingus Support&amp;#8221;.

Keep an eye out for the next competition phase which we should be announcing shortly.</description>

      <description>The second week of the competition is over and we can now announce the winner of a Hairy Baby t-shirt.

Mark Twomey from Cork in Ireland wins with his hilarious review of the Gillette Fusion Power razor. As with last week&amp;#8217;s winner, Mark is vying for top spot on google.ie. Well done Mark. His review of Sweeney Todd is pure genius too!
As before, get your reviews in by any of the methods we support and you win a funky t-shirt with a logo like this:</description>
