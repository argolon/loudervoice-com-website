      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LouderVoice Wins a Golden Spider</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were terribly disappointed last Thursday that massive flooding in West Cork prevented us from attending the 2009 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goldenspiders.ie/&#34;&gt;Golden Spiders Awards&lt;/a&gt;. The awards are the most high profile in Ireland and a win can have serious business benefits locally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So imagine our shock to hear that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goldenspiders.ie/winners_2009.php&#34;&gt;we won the e-business category&lt;/a&gt;! We were up against some incredibly impressive competition. Getting this recognition from our industry peers on the judging panel really is satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
