      <p>Sometimes it’s the simple features which provide the most value and that’s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.</p>
<h3 id="extra-questions"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></h3>
<p>Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number. But feel free to use the feature in whatever way makes sense for your business. We’d love to hear what you come up with!</p>

      <p>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!</p>
<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.iia.ie/">IIA</a> is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “<a href="http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/">8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff</a>“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.</p>
<p>The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</p>

        Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>To describe <a href="http://www.riverdance.com">Riverdance</a> as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

      <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing Conference</a> was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

        LouderVoice Reviews on Facebook Pages
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">their Facebook Page</a>. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

        12 Statistics on Consumer Reviews

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

      <p>Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Ferry to Ireland</a>. This much needed service operating from <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Swansea to Cork</a> is proving to be a major success for the region.

</p>
<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

        Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

      <p>Those of you who have followed LouderVoice over the past few years have probably noticed that things have changed a lot in the last few months. All of those changes have been for the better and much of it is due to Karl Llewellyn, our new Head of Sales.</p>
<p>Karl is responsible for driving our new partner strategy and recruiting web professionals as partners so they can offer LouderVoice to their customers. Loudervoice already has customers internationally, but partners are a key part of our formal launch into the UK this year.</p>

<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

<p>The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</p>

</p>
<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

      <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing Conference</a> was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

        LouderVoice Reviews on Facebook Pages
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">their Facebook Page</a>. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

      <p>Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Ferry to Ireland</a>. This much needed service operating from <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Swansea to Cork</a> is proving to be a major success for the region.

<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

        Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

Paul Brugger launched <a href="http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork">the Cork site last year</a> and it has been growing at an amazing rate.

<p>Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork">loudervoice.com</a>, on <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx">Google Android</a> mobile phones and shared by users to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice">Facebook</a> and a multitude of other social networking sites.

      <p><a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> was the first reviews company to realise the importance of <a href="http://twitter.com/loudervoice">Twitter</a>. That’s why we’re the people behind <a href="http://twitter.com/review">@review</a> which we launched in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

<p>This is the first Irish Android application and one of the very first reviewing applications on the platform.</p>
<p>You’ll have to patiently wait for the launches of the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/magic/overview.html">HTC Magic</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5229244/meet-the-i7500-samsungs-first-android-phone">Samsung I7500</a> before Â most Irish people can try it out.

      <p>We’re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01">Bubble Brothers</a> wine site. Julian, their <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/">Wine 2.0 guru</a>, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-211" title="highfield_bubblebrothers" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/highfield_bubblebrothers-300x297.jpg" alt="highfield_bubblebrothers" width="300" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.</p>
<p>The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from <a href="http://www.bytesurgery.com/blog/">Robin Blandford</a>.</p>

      <p>We quietly launched V2 of our <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it’d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by <a href="http://doepud.co.uk/">Doepud</a>) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit. We have also added the ability to follow other reviewers so that all of their activity is visible on your logged-in home page on the site.</p>

      <p>We were delighted to get two pieces on LouderVoice in the <a href="http://www.examiner.ie/">Irish Examiner</a> newspaper recently. On Friday Feb 1st, Bernie Goldbach did a great column focused on mini-reviewing which he <a href="http://www.insideview.ie/irisheyes/2008/02/mini-reviews-on.html">re-posted on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it. Apologies for the roughness of the scan and for not OCRing it. The photograph is by Denis Minihane. Click on picture to see high-res original.</p>

      <p>The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> but takes much less effort.</p>
<p>After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to <a href="http://bifsniff.com/">Frank Prendergast</a> for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:</p>

      <p>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!</p>
<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

        LouderVoice Launches Dedicated Social Reviews for Facebook

      <p>As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.</p>
<p>All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but <a href="https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/">this Package</a> enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.</p>
<p>Many of the businesses who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.</p>

      <p>There is a great piece over on <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/7622-why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-negative-at-all">Econsultancy about negative reviews</a>. Well worth a read. It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.iia.ie/">IIA</a> is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “<a href="http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/">8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff</a>“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.</p>
<p>The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</p>

      <p>To describe <a href="http://www.riverdance.com">Riverdance</a> as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.</p>

</p>
<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

        LouderVoice Reviews on Facebook Pages
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">their Facebook Page</a>. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

        12 Statistics on Consumer Reviews

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

      <p>Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Ferry to Ireland</a>. This much needed service operating from <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Swansea to Cork</a> is proving to be a major success for the region. So you can imagine our excitement at LouderVoice becoming part of this story by powering the <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">customer reviews on their site</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

        Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

Paul Brugger launched <a href="http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork">the Cork site last year</a> and it has been growing at an amazing rate.

</p>
<p>Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork">loudervoice.com</a>, on <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx">Google Android</a> mobile phones and shared by users to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice">Facebook</a> and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.</p>

<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

      <p>We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

<p>The <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business site</a> gives the high level overview of our services which are currently in three areas:</p>

<li>White-label review service based on a secure XML API</li>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

      <p>We quietly launched V2 of our <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it’d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by <a href="http://doepud.co.uk/">Doepud</a>) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit. We have also added the ability to follow other reviewers so that all of their activity is visible on your logged-in home page on the site.</p>

      <p>The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> but takes much less effort.</p>
<p>After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to <a href="http://bifsniff.com/">Frank Prendergast</a> for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:</p>

      <p>Nielsen’s latest Global Trust in Advertising report, which surveyed more than 28,000 Internet respondents in 56 countries, shows that 92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family, followed closely by 70% trusting online reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

<p>You’ll have to patiently wait for the launches of the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/magic/overview.html">HTC Magic</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5229244/meet-the-i7500-samsungs-first-android-phone">Samsung I7500</a> before Â most Irish people can try it out. Anyone living in countries where Android is already live can install it now.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

        Your Opinion on Free-Form Twitter Reviews

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’ve been promising it forever and now we’re finally ready to unveil the all-new LouderVoice WordPress plug-in V2.0. This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.</p>
<p>The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from <a href="http://www.bytesurgery.com/blog/">Robin Blandford</a>.</p>

        Easy Blog Reviews with Flag Tags

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> but takes much less effort.</p>
<p>After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to <a href="http://bifsniff.com/">Frank Prendergast</a> for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

<p>In these difficult times for hotels, any advantage that they can gain is worthwhile. On-site reviews are a proven way of growing sales and on-site sales for hotels means they improve their margin.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

      <p>As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.</p>
<p>All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but <a href="https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/">this Package</a> enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.</p>
<p>Many of the businesses who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.</p>

        Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

      <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing Conference</a> was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

        Citylocal Cork Reviews on LouderVoice

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’ve always been impressed with the <a href="http://www.citylocal.co.uk/">Citylocal franchise</a> which was built by Nazir Daud in the UK. Paul Brugger launched <a href="http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork">the Cork site last year</a> and it has been growing at an amazing rate. CityLocal Cork is a Business Directory and community website that provides local information on Businesses, News, Events, Free Ads, Property and Cinema listings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.citylocal.ie/cork"><img class="aligncenter" title="Citylocal Cork" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/10/citylocal-cork-reviews-on-loudervoice/city-logo-anim.gif" alt="" width="75" height="75" /></a>
</p>
<p>Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on <a href="https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork">loudervoice.com</a>, on <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx">Google Android</a> mobile phones and shared by users to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice">Facebook</a> and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.</p>

      <p>One of the most common requests we get from partners and customers is to have the same reviews SEO functionality on ASP.NET as they do for PHP and WordPress sites. And we’re delighted to say that this is now available.</p>
<p>All of our Packages provide Google Juice and Star Ratings in Search results to client sites via our review Hub, <a href="http://www.louderyou.com/">LouderYou</a>. The advantage of this approach is ease of deployment. Our code can be added in seconds to a web-page and reviews are then live. Those reviews are indexed on our hub within hours.</p>

      <p>Nielsen’s latest Global Trust in Advertising report, which surveyed more than 28,000 Internet respondents in 56 countries, shows that 92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family, followed closely by 70% trusting online reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in.

<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>More and more sites are moving to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> as their platform. We have long been WP users and all of our sites are built on it.</p>
<p>The LouderVoice reviews system has always supported WordPress sites but we recently decided to make it even easier to deploy on them.</p>

</p>
<p>The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

        Why a negative review may not be so bad after all
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a great piece over on <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/7622-why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-negative-at-all">Econsultancy about negative reviews</a>. Well worth a read. It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

        Why a negative review may not be so bad after all

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a great piece over on <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/7622-why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-negative-at-all">Econsultancy about negative reviews</a>. Well worth a read. It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

        Bubble Brothers goes live with the new LouderVoice Reviews Widget

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01">Bubble Brothers</a> wine site. Julian, their <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/">Wine 2.0 guru</a>, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-211" title="highfield_bubblebrothers" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/highfield_bubblebrothers-300x297.jpg" alt="highfield_bubblebrothers" width="300" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to Loud Reviewer <a href="https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/">Frank Prendergast</a> for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is <a href="https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin">available here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.</p>

      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

        Bubble Brothers goes live with the new LouderVoice Reviews Widget
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01">Bubble Brothers</a> wine site. Julian, their <a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/">Wine 2.0 guru</a>, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-211" title="highfield_bubblebrothers" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/highfield_bubblebrothers-300x297.jpg" alt="highfield_bubblebrothers" width="300" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use <a href="http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/">Ecommerce Templates</a> for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!</p>

      <p>Yesterday I attended the excellent <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing</a> event in Dublin organised by <a href="http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/">Proactiv Marketing</a>. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

      <p><a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> was the first reviews company to realise the importance of <a href="http://twitter.com/loudervoice">Twitter</a>. That’s why we’re the people behind <a href="http://twitter.com/review">@review</a> which we launched in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

      <p>Yesterday I attended the excellent <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing</a> event in Dublin organised by <a href="http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/">Proactiv Marketing</a>. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I attended the excellent <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing</a> event in Dublin organised by <a href="http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/">Proactiv Marketing</a>. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

      <p>Yesterday evening we uploaded the first public beta of our Google Android mobile application to the Android Market.</p>

<p>This is the first Irish Android application and one of the very first reviewing applications on the platform.</p>
<p>You’ll have to patiently wait for the launches of the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/magic/overview.html">HTC Magic</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5229244/meet-the-i7500-samsungs-first-android-phone">Samsung I7500</a> before Â most Irish people can try it out.

Quotes from Conor, <a href="http://twitter.com/patphelan">Pat Phelan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith">Steve Troughton-Smith</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An awful lot of developers had no route to market before the App Store came along,â€ says Conor Oâ€™Neill, software industry veteran and managing director of online review site LouderVoice. He cites the case of Steven Troughton-Smith, a 20-year-old Irish student who has sold thousands of copies of his iPhone applications. In the first six days it was available, Speed, an application that shows how fast youâ€™re travelling, was downloaded 36,000 times. The application was free at that time, but now sells for â‚¬0.79.</p>

      <p>Conor is on <a href="http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/programmes/6/the-right-hook.html">The Right Hook</a> radio show this evening on Newstalk with Joe Drumgoole from <a href="http://www.putplace.com/">PutPlace</a>. He’ll be talking about the LouderVoice service in general and kicking off an SMS reviews push in conjunction with the show. You can listen live on the web here.</p>

<p>As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There’ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews. We also provide custom keywords for our business clients and partners.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p><a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> was the first reviews company to realise the importance of <a href="http://twitter.com/loudervoice">Twitter</a>. That’s why we’re the people behind <a href="http://twitter.com/review">@review</a> which we launched in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

        Your Opinion on Free-Form Twitter Reviews

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

      <p>Over the past few months we have been trialling our business services with several clients. Some of those are already live, others will go live over the next quarter. We now have <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">a very nice brochure site</a> to go with these services and a very powerful content moderation back-end for our clients.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business site</a> gives the high level overview of our services which are currently in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>White-label review service based on a secure XML API</li>
<li>SMS reviews and customer feedback</li>
<li>Custom review widgets</li>
</ul>
<div>
  These can be used by businesses of any size and we are currently talking to clients that range from one-person operations to some in the Fortune 500.Ã‚Â

The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/">WordPress.org</a>. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.</p>

This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.</p>
<p>The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from <a href="http://www.bytesurgery.com/blog/">Robin Blandford</a>.</p>

      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>

      <p>We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.</p>
<p>Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the <strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: normal;">keyword </span></span>“Re”</em></strong> and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.</p>

<p>The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by <a href="http://doepud.co.uk/">Doepud</a>) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit.
