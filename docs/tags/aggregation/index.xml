      <description>Today marks the launch of technology news and reviews site teic.ie, which has to be one of the best site names we&amp;#8217;ve seen!Â It&amp;#8217;s written by Adam Maguire who is one of the finest technology and business journalists in the country. Adam&amp;#8217;s reviews are in-depth and extremely knowledgeable. The use of a blog format means he should quickly see a community forming around the site and there is no reason we won&amp;#8217;t have a European Gizmodo or Engadget on our hands.</description>
