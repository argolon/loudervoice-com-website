      <p>It’s always a delight to work with like-minded companies so we were doubly pleased when <a href="http://www.puddleducks.ie/">Puddleducks.ie</a> contacted us recently about using the <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com">LouderVoice</a> customer reviews system on their site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>Puddleducks is a rapidly growing online retailer of outdoor clothing for bothÂ childrenâ€™s and adults. In fact, Â we first encountered them as personal customers of their fantastic products.Â Their range includes Swedish designed dungarees, jackets and trousers for children, as well as waterproof clothing and work wear for adults.</p>

        LouderVoice in 2008

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

      <p>Over the past few months we have been trialling our business services with several clients. Some of those are already live, others will go live over the next quarter. We now have <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">a very nice brochure site</a> to go with these services and a very powerful content moderation back-end for our clients.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business site</a> gives the high level overview of our services which are currently in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>White-label review service based on a secure XML API</li>
<li>SMS reviews and customer feedback</li>
<li>Custom review widgets</li>
</ul>
<div>
  These can be used by businesses of any size and we are currently talking to clients that range from one-person operations to some in the Fortune 500.Ã‚Â
