      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt; was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760&#34; title=&#34;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;507&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg 724w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03-300x62.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
