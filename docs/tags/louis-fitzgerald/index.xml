      <description>&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ve spent the past few months in &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/business&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; creating Version 2 of our review widget and have been quietly rolling it out on sites since early August. In our humble opinion, it is the best widget-based reviews solution on the market globally. Not only can it be implemented on most sites in under 10 minutes, it is also fully Facebook and Twitter enabled and can be easily styled to blend seamlessly into your site&lt;/p&gt;</description>
