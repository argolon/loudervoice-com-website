      <description>LouderVoice and WSI have been working together globally since early 2011. We have now joined forces to offer a compelling Social solution for SMEs in the UK.
Online marketing is an ever-moving target and it can be hard for SMEs to feel on top of everything. To solve this, WSIâ€™s offerings and LouderVoice&amp;#8217;s Social Reviews are now available as an off-the-shelf solution that is optimised for the UK. Every business can have their online presence live and social-powered with almost no effort.</description>
