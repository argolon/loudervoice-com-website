      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first company to do Social Reviews on Twitter, way back in 2007, we have finally given in to all the (many!) demands for a Facebook-only solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of our Packages have had a powerful Facebook component since 2009 but &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/products/facebook-reviews-package/&#34;&gt;this Package&lt;/a&gt; enables small businesses, who may not even have their own web-site, to show and solicit customer reviews on their Facebook Page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the¬†businesses¬†who have contacted us had previously used the old built-in Facebook reviews App. Whilst it was pretty awful, it worked, and they miss it! So we love being the company to put a smile back on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated ‚ÄúOur Reviews‚Äù tab on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=ts&#34;&gt;their Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now a simple review written on a client‚Äôs site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it‚Äôs about selling by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a fantastic time at the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/23/facebook-garage-ireland-2/&#34;&gt;Irish Facebook Garage&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin on Thursday. A packed room of approx 150 people with a wide range of backgrounds heard 5 speakers cover a variety of topics over the space of 2.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/&#34;&gt;Web2Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at some point next week. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of Conor‚Äôs live demo of the LouderVoice reviews widget + Facebook Connect in action. This widget will be formally launched in the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
