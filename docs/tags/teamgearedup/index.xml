      <description>&lt;p&gt;We closed the first phase of the reviews competition a few weeks ago but we were so blown away by the review by Alx Cahiz of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.teamgearedup.com/2008/02/geared-up-review-loaded-boards-415in-dervish-longboard.html&#34;&gt;stunning Dervish Longboard&lt;/a&gt; that we had to give him a prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/03/another-competition-winner/2294966258_e944203188_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;160&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This wasnâ€™t just review of the week, I think it was review of the month! Looking forward to seeing what else he comes up with. It should also be said that &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.teamgearedup.com&#34;&gt;TeamGearedUp&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best blogs out there about outdoor sports and activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
