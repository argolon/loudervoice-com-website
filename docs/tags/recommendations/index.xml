      <description>&lt;p&gt;The LouderVoice &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;customer reviews service&lt;/a&gt; is getting a lot of attention from businesses who are looking for ways to retain customers and grow sales in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the latest research from Avail Intellingence comes as no surprise to us. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetretailing.net/news/customer-reviews-and-feedback-score-highest-with-online-shoppers&#34;&gt;InternetRetailing&lt;/a&gt; reports that the research shows over a third (36%) of respondents rated peer opinions such as recommendations, reviews and customer generated wish lists as the most useful aspect of an Internet-shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
