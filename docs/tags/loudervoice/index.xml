      <title>New features help you to connect better with your customers using reviews</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s the simple features which provide the most value and that’s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;extra-questions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number. But feel free to use the feature in whatever way makes sense for your business. We’d love to hear what you come up with!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do when I land on a site I haven’t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were really excited recently to sign-up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.floradoor.com/&#34;&gt;Floradoor&lt;/a&gt; in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is simply a superb idea by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/&#34;&gt;l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles&lt;/a&gt; near Grenoble and our partners &lt;a href=&#34;http://wsiclarinet.com/&#34;&gt;Thierry André FOUCHER&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsibds.com/&#34;&gt;WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies&lt;/a&gt;. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557&#34;&gt;Facebook Page too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were very interested to see an MSNBC article on how hotels are &lt;a href=&#34;http://travelkit.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/22/12188135-how-hotels-are-embracing-online-customer-reviews?lite&#34;&gt;embracing online customer reviews&lt;/a&gt;. It matches our own experience, as our reviewing solutions are proving a major hit with businesses in the hospitality and travel sectors everywhere. We have seen a string of deployments in UK, Ireland, France and the US in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of this growth, we’re delighted to announce that we have have just gone live with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dalatahotelgroup.com/&#34;&gt;the Dalata Group’s&lt;/a&gt; 11 Maldron and 14 partner hotels in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Word of Mouth Still Most Trusted Resource Says Nielsen</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2012/04/16/word-of-mouth-still-most-trusted-resource-says-nielsen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nielsen’s latest Global Trust in Advertising report, which surveyed more than 28,000 Internet respondents in 56 countries, shows that 92% of people trust recommendations from friends and family, followed closely by 70% trusting online reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the highlight stats. Read the great piece about it over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://socialcommercetoday.com/word-of-mouth-still-most-trusted-resource-says-nielsen-implications-for-social-commerce/&#34;&gt;Social Commerce Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2605 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;trust-in-advertising&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;570&#34; height=&#34;486&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising.png 570w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/trust-in-advertising-300x255.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more sites are moving to &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; as their platform. We have long been WP users and all of our sites are built on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The LouderVoice reviews system has always supported WordPress sites but we recently decided to make it even easier to deploy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/blue-l.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2676 aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;blue-l&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/02/loudervoice-reviews-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available/blue-l.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new LouderVoice Reviews plug-in is now available and included in the price of all of our Packages. With a few quick clicks, you can install the plug-in and configure reviews for one or more pages on any WP site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The power of Twitter to connect people has proven itself yet again. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ann_donnelly&#34;&gt;Ann Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-business.ie/&#34;&gt;O’Mahony Donnelly E-Business&lt;/a&gt;, down the road in Clonakilty, pointed us to an article by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmgcustommedia.com/&#34;&gt;TMG Custom Media&lt;/a&gt; in Washington DC. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/TMGmedia&#34;&gt;A few tweets later&lt;/a&gt; and we were having an email exchange with Andrew Hanelly in TMG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is a great Q&amp;amp;A over on TMG about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://engage.tmgcustommedia.com/2011/03/5-myths-about-customer-reviews-and-the-wild-web/&#34;&gt;5 Myths of Customer Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. We think it deals with the number one issue that still stops people from adding reviews to their site – fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My talk on customer reviews at the IIA’s “8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff” event seemed to go down very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.iia.ie/2011/audio-conor-oneill-loudervoice-at-%E2%80%9C8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff%E2%80%9D/&#34;&gt;Judge for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To describe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com&#34;&gt;Riverdance&lt;/a&gt; as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com/the-show/fan-reviews/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1906  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Riverdance Reviews&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;83&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png 550w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post-300x45.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year again! LouderVoice has been at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leweb.net&#34;&gt;Le Web&lt;/a&gt; every year since 2006. Back then, it was just some ideas and a very basic Alpha, this time we are part of the Irish Pavilion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leweb.net&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1826  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;leweb_logo&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/02/loudervoice-in-ireland-demozone-at-le-web/leweb_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;100&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bestconnected.enterprise-ireland.com/ireland-at-leweb-2010/&#34;&gt;Enterprise Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has put together a unique Demozone at Le Web. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/2010/12/01/ireland-demozone-startups-at-le-web/&#34;&gt;11 hot Irish start-ups&lt;/a&gt; including LouderVoice will be there.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt; was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760&#34; title=&#34;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;507&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg 724w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03-300x62.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LouderVoice Reviews on Facebook Pages</title>

      <guid>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2010/08/27/loudervoice-reviews-on-facebook-pages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=ts&#34;&gt;their Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html&#34;&gt;over on Search Engine People&lt;/a&gt;. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few of their gems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt; of online consumers &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, &lt;strong&gt;8% trust celebrities&lt;/strong&gt; (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70%&lt;/strong&gt; consult reviews or ratings &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; purchasing&lt;/strong&gt; (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 in 10&lt;/strong&gt; who read reviews &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; them with friends, family &amp;amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45%&lt;/strong&gt; say they are &lt;strong&gt;influenced&lt;/strong&gt; a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.)

      <title>Fastnet Line Cork-Swansea Ferry on-board with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Ferry to Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. This much needed service operating from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;Swansea to Cork&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be a major success for the region. So you can imagine our excitement at LouderVoice becoming part of this story by powering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;customer reviews on their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1743  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fastnet Line&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/06/fastnet-line-cork-swansea-ferry-on-board-with-loudervoice/logo2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;266&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html&#34;&gt;response from travellers&lt;/a&gt; has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Parcel2Ship&lt;/a&gt; which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Parcel2Ship&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing&lt;/a&gt; event in Dublin organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/&#34;&gt;Proactiv Marketing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the past few months in &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/business&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; creating Version 2 of our review widget and have been quietly rolling it out on sites since early August. In our humble opinion, it is the best widget-based reviews solution on the market globally. Not only can it be implemented on most sites in under 10 minutes, it is also fully Facebook and Twitter enabled and can be easily styled to blend seamlessly into your site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Citylocal Cork Reviews on LouderVoice</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2009/09/10/citylocal-cork-reviews-on-loudervoice/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2009 10:10:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2009/09/10/citylocal-cork-reviews-on-loudervoice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve always been impressed with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Citylocal franchise&lt;/a&gt; which was built by Nazir Daud in the UK. Paul Brugger launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.ie/Cork&#34;&gt;the Cork site last year&lt;/a&gt; and it has been growing at an amazing rate. CityLocal Cork is a Business Directory and community website that provides local information on Businesses, News, Events, Free Ads, Property and Cinema listings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylocal.ie/cork&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Citylocal Cork&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/10/citylocal-cork-reviews-on-loudervoice/city-logo-anim.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;75&#34; height=&#34;75&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visitors to Citylocal often leave reviews of the businesses they find there. We are now aggregating those reviews into our system, adding to the already powerful SEO mojo of Citylocal. By doing this, Citylocal’s customers will now see their reviews appearing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/tags/citylocal+cork&#34;&gt;loudervoice.com&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-marinosoftware-loudervoice-ipi.aspx&#34;&gt;Google Android&lt;/a&gt; mobile phones and shared by users to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and a multitude of other social networking sites. In every case, the reviews point back to their Citylocal presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it growing year by year but the latest Nielsen research really drives it home. There is a great piece about it over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=5AD7D61B-1A64-6A71-CE5A80966183F2B5&#34;&gt;Computerworld&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consumer reviews and personal recommendations are as important as trusted brand reviews for Internet consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen survey, the largest of its kind, shows that 90 percent of Internet consumers worldwide trust recommendations from people they know, while 70 percent trust consumer opinions posted online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a fantastic time at the second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/23/facebook-garage-ireland-2/&#34;&gt;Irish Facebook Garage&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin on Thursday. A packed room of approx 150 people with a wide range of backgrounds heard 5 speakers cover a variety of topics over the space of 2.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be full coverage including video and all the PPTs available over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.web2ireland.org/&#34;&gt;Web2Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at some point next week. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of Conor’s live demo of the LouderVoice reviews widget + Facebook Connect in action. This widget will be formally launched in the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; was the first reviews company to realise the importance of &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/loudervoice&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why we’re the people behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/review&#34;&gt;@review&lt;/a&gt; which we launched in June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bubble Brothers goes live with the new LouderVoice Reviews Widget</title>

      <guid>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2009/04/28/bubble-brothers-goes-live-with-the-new-loudervoice-reviews-widget/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased as punch to announce that our brand new customer reviews widget has just gone live on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01&#34;&gt;Bubble Brothers&lt;/a&gt; wine site. Julian, their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Wine 2.0 guru&lt;/a&gt;, has always been at the forefront of social media adoption and the addition of our widget complements all of their other online activities beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=HIGH01&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-211&#34; title=&#34;highfield_bubblebrothers&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/highfield_bubblebrothers-300x297.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;highfield_bubblebrothers&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;297&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key thing about the widget is the ease of implementation. One line of code was added to the Bubble Brothers product page template (they use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/&#34;&gt;Ecommerce Templates&lt;/a&gt; for their site), a few minor logo tweaks later and they were up and running. No development on their side and just some quick colour/size adjustments by us. That’s all it takes to review-enable an entire site!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The LouderVoice &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;customer reviews service&lt;/a&gt; is getting a lot of attention from businesses who are looking for ways to retain customers and grow sales in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the latest research from Avail Intellingence comes as no surprise to us. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetretailing.net/news/customer-reviews-and-feedback-score-highest-with-online-shoppers&#34;&gt;InternetRetailing&lt;/a&gt; reports that the research shows over a third (36%) of respondents rated peer opinions such as recommendations, reviews and customer generated wish lists as the most useful aspect of an Internet-shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have two bits of news about our LouderVoice plug-in. The first is that it is now WordPress 2.7 compatible and the second is that we have moved the hosting over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/loudervoice/&#34;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;. This means that from now on, when we update it, you’ll see a notification in your WordPress Admin Panel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the 2.7 compatibility change, the only other major feature is that you can opt to have all the contextual information about the review, including the stars, at the end of the text. Full instructions in the readme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a fantastic year in &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In January we launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/&#34;&gt;Flag Tag reviewing&lt;/a&gt; which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awards.ie/&#34;&gt;Irish Blog Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In July we started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice&#34;&gt;Get Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In September we launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/&#34;&gt;Simple SMS reviews&lt;/a&gt; requiring just a single keyword&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We were also Shortlisted in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awards.ie/&#34;&gt;Irish Web Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In October we launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice for Business&lt;/a&gt; to great attention&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We were also &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/&#34;&gt;shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In November, our first B2B client, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.klipsch.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Klipsch&lt;/a&gt;, went live&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Announcing Simple SMS Reviews</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/</link>

      <guid>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We kicked off SMS reviewing last year using the same structured message format which we devised for Twitter and Jaiku. Whilst it suits a lot of our users, particularly those who want their reviews to appear instantly, many others felt that the structure was overly complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this user feedback, we are now launching Simple SMS Reviews. The idea here is that you send your review to the same number as before (+353-87-9409325 or +44-778-6205133), you begin your SMS with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;keyword &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Re”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and then the remainder of the SMS is your review in whatever style you like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He’ll be talking about the LouderVoice service in general and kicking off an SMS reviews push in conjunction with the show. You can listen live on the web here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;George Hook&#34; src=&#34;http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/shows/images/right%20hook.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;581&#34; height=&#34;212&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There’ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews. We also provide custom keywords for our business clients and partners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://79.170.40.33/tastefestivals.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=73&amp;amp;Itemid=92&#34;&gt;Taste of Cork Food Festival&lt;/a&gt; is coming this weekend in the deep south of Ireland. There will by myriad stands offering food and beverages to sample including lots of famous Munster Artisan producers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://79.170.40.33/tastefestivals.ie/images/banners/beef2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re partnering with several of the exhibitors including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ummera.com/wordpress/?p=117&#34;&gt;Ummera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bubblebrothers.com/blog&#34;&gt;Bubble Brothers&lt;/a&gt; to encourage those who attend to review both the event and the individual stands. Reviews can be submitted by any of the usual methods but &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/mobile&#34;&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; seems the most appropriate. Keep an eye out for our flyers on the stands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It currently supports 186 different social sites and we’re thrilled that they have just added LouderVoice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve signed up for an account, you just have to provide your LouderVoice username for them to pull in the titles of your reviews into your Profilactic lifestream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New version of LouderVoice WordPress Plug-in</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2008/06/04/new-version-of-loudervoice-wordpress-plug-in/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Loud Reviewer &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/people/frankp/&#34;&gt;Frank Prendergast&lt;/a&gt; for spotting a bug in our WordPress plug-in. This bug prevented users from setting review posts to publish in the future. The bug has now been fixed and the updated plug-in is &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wordpress_plugin&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably noticed how quiet we’ve been on the blog. Not only have we been fixing a lot of small bugs on the site that crept in with the Version2 launch but we’re been working hard on building our API. This will enable other sites to embed our reviewing functionality on their pages. We’ll be going live very shortly with the first partner on this. This XML API is accessible directly, using a PHP library or using a JS library (with more coming soon).Ã‚Â  If this is something you’d like to hear more about, please contact conor AT loudervoice DOT com. We’re putting together some information pages on it at the moment too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We closed the first phase of the reviews competition a few weeks ago but we were so blown away by the review by Alx Cahiz of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.teamgearedup.com/2008/02/geared-up-review-loaded-boards-415in-dervish-longboard.html&#34;&gt;stunning Dervish Longboard&lt;/a&gt; that we had to give him a prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/03/another-competition-winner/2294966258_e944203188_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;160&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just review of the week, I think it was review of the month! Looking forward to seeing what else he comes up with. It should also be said that &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.teamgearedup.com&#34;&gt;TeamGearedUp&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best blogs out there about outdoor sports and activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been promising it forever and now we’re finally ready to unveil the all-new LouderVoice WordPress plug-in V2.0. This enables you to write reviews on your blog using an open standard called hReview. Sites like LouderVoice can then index and interpret them more intelligently than raw blog-posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new plug-in is a total re-write based on lots of user feedback and, in particular, some fantastic suggestions and guidance from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bytesurgery.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Robin Blandford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is LouderVoice V2 all about?</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2008/03/30/what-is-loudervoice-v2-all-about/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 08:57:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2008/03/30/what-is-loudervoice-v2-all-about/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We quietly launched V2 of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; on the night before the Irish Blog Awards and have been tweaking for a few weeks. There is a lot more to come but we thought it’d be good to let you know what has changed now since we have a few more announcements coming in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main aim with V2 was to make the activity on the site much more visible to the users and provide more opportunities to interact with others on the site. The most obvious change (apart from the very sexy re-design by &lt;a href=&#34;http://doepud.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Doepud&lt;/a&gt;) in that area is that all of the latest/best reviews are visible on every page you visit. We have also added the ability to follow other reviewers so that all of their activity is visible on your logged-in home page on the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to get two pieces on LouderVoice in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.examiner.ie/&#34;&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/a&gt; newspaper recently. On Friday Feb 1st, Bernie Goldbach did a great column focused on mini-reviewing which he &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insideview.ie/irisheyes/2008/02/mini-reviews-on.html&#34;&gt;re-posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then on Monday 4th, Dan MacCarthy published an extensive interview with Conor the LouderVoice CEO. As there is no online copy, I have uploaded a scan of it. Apologies for the roughness of the scan and for not OCRing it. The photograph is by Denis Minihane.

      <title>Easy Blog Reviews with Flag Tags</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The approach we have taken with reviews on blogs until now has been built around a standard called hreview. Many bloggers are a fan of this portable format and we continue to support it strongly. But we have received many requests for something more lightweight which still enables people to get their reviews into &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/&#34;&gt;LouderVoice&lt;/a&gt; but takes much less effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After trying a variety of approaches we have settled on something we are calling Flag Tags (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://bifsniff.com/&#34;&gt;Frank Prendergast&lt;/a&gt; for coining this). The idea is simple. If you are writing a blog post that is a review, you need to ensure three very basic things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
