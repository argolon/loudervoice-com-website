      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were terribly disappointed last Thursday that massive flooding in West Cork prevented us from attending the 2009 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goldenspiders.ie/&#34;&gt;Golden Spiders Awards&lt;/a&gt;. The awards are the most high profile in Ireland and a win can have serious business benefits locally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So imagine our shock to hear that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goldenspiders.ie/winners_2009.php&#34;&gt;we won the e-business category&lt;/a&gt;! We were up against some incredibly impressive competition. Getting this recognition from our industry peers on the judging panel really is satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
