      <description>What a fantastic couple of weeks in the life of LouderVoice. Yesterday we found out we&amp;#8217;ve been shortlisted for New Company of The Year by The Irish Software Association. This is one helluva heavy-duty event and we&amp;#8217;re nervous about the interview process already.

There willÂ be lots more announcements and coverage in the next two weeks so watch closely.</description>
