      <description>Due to ongoing strong demand both in France and Canada, LouderVoice is now available fully localised to French.
 As with Spanish and Russian, this includes both the entire end-user experience and the review management back-end for businesses.
Of course all of our powerful Social integrations work seamlessly in French too and provide the full 360 degree view from reviews on a businesses site to reviews on Facebook and back again.</description>
