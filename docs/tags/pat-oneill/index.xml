      <description>It&amp;#8217;s always a pleasure to meet like-minded people who understand the power of online reviews for businesses. Pat O&amp;#8217;Neill of HotelConsult is one of those people and we&amp;#8217;re thrilled to be working with him in the hotel space.
In these difficult times for hotels, any advantage that they can gain is worthwhile. On-site reviews are a proven way of growing sales and on-site sales for hotels means they improve their margin.</description>
