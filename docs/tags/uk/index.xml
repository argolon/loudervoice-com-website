      <description>&lt;p&gt;LouderVoice and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.totalwsinetsolutions.com/&#34;&gt;WSI&lt;/a&gt; have been working together globally since early 2011. We have now joined forces to offer a compelling Social solution for SMEs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Online marketing is an ever-moving target and it can be hard for SMEs to feel on top of everything. To solve this, WSI’s offerings and &lt;a href=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/products&#34;&gt;LouderVoice’s Social Reviews&lt;/a&gt; are now available as an off-the-shelf solution that is optimised for the UK. Every business can have their online presence live and social-powered with almost no effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Parcel2Ship&lt;/a&gt; which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Parcel2Ship&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;321&#34; height=&#34;55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
