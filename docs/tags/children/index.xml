      <description>It&amp;#8217;s always a delight to work with like-minded companies so we were doubly pleased when Puddleducks.ie contacted us recently about using the LouderVoice customer reviews system on their site.
 Puddleducks is a rapidly growing online retailer of outdoor clothing for bothÂ childrenâ€™s and adults. In fact, Â we first encountered them as personal customers of their fantastic products.Â Their range includes Swedish designed dungarees, jackets and trousers for children, as well as waterproof clothing and work wear for adults.</description>
