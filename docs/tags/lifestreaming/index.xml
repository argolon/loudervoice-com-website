      <description>Profilactic has been doing Lifestreaming longer than most.

It&amp;#8217;s a site where you pull in your profiles from all your social sites like Twitter/Jaiku/Pownce/Bebo/MySpace etc so that your aggregated activity online is visible from one place. It currently supports 186 different social sites and we&amp;#8217;re thrilled that they have just added LouderVoice.
Once you&amp;#8217;ve signed up for an account, you just have to provide your LouderVoice username for them to pull in the titles of your reviews into your Profilactic lifestream.</description>
