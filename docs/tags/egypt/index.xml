      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do when I land on a site I havenâ€™t used before is to check their reviews. Good or bad, I want to see that it is a company which values feedback and is actively providing services or products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were really excited recently to sign-up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.floradoor.com/&#34;&gt;Floradoor&lt;/a&gt; in Cairo as our first African client. This high-end florist delivers flowers locally for a global customer base and it has been a joy to read their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
