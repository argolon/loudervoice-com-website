      <p>Sometimes it’s the simple features which provide the most value and that’s definitely the case with two of our most recent updates.</p>
<h3 id="extra-questions"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></h3>
<p>Clients now have the ability to ask up to 5 extra optional questions from reviewers. This is not intended as a replacement for questionnaires or surveys but is more for extra context. For example, some of our hotel clients use it to ask for the room number. But feel free to use the feature in whatever way makes sense for your business. We’d love to hear what you come up with!</p>

      <p>We always strongly encourage our clients to request reviews using every channel available to them, particularly if the bulk of their business is not online. This can be done using receipts, invoices, compliment slips, phone calls or, in the case of our latest restaurant client in France, using an iPad!</p>
<p>This is simply a superb idea by <a href="http://www.auberge-des-trois-pucelles.fr/avis-clients/">l’Auberge des Trois Pucelles</a> near Grenoble and our partners <a href="http://wsiclarinet.com/">Thierry André FOUCHER</a> and <a href="http://www.wsibds.com/">WSI Belledonne Digital Strategies</a>. They have an iPad at the cash-register with their reviews page pre-loaded in the browser. As customers wait to complete payment, staff members ask if they’d like to leave a review. A few moments later that review is live on their site and on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AubergeDesTroisPucelles/app_149134505160557">Facebook Page too</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the reviews business for quite a few years so we’re not remotely surprised by this data. But our experience over the past 12 months is that small businesses are now realising the importance of reviews and adding customer reviews solutions to their sites and Facebook. This is as true in rural Ireland as it is in Del Mar California.</p>

It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.</p>

Called “<a href="http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/">8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff</a>“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.</p>
<p>The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</p>

        Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>To describe <a href="http://www.riverdance.com">Riverdance</a> as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.</p>

</p>
<p>The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.</p>

      <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing Conference</a> was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.</p>

</p>
<p>Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We have just added a new Facebook capability for all of our customers. They can now show all their latest reviews in a dedicated “Our Reviews” tab on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LouderVoice?v=app_140294209327173&amp;ref=ts#!/LouderVoice?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">their Facebook Page</a>. Whilst our Facebook Connect implementation has always given reviewers the ability to post their reviews to their personal wall, this new feature enables our clients to showcase their reviews from all their products and services in one place.</p>
<p>Now a simple review written on a client’s site or submitted by SMS can appear on their Facebook Page within minutes, building confidence and guiding others who want to know more about that business. Fundamentally it’s about selling by word of mouth.</p>

      <p>There is a fantastic block of stats about consumer reviews <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/12-statistics-on-consumer-reviews.html">over on Search Engine People</a>. If you are wondering why this is such a strong growth area, wonder no longer!</p>
<p>A few of their gems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>90%</strong> of online consumers <strong>trust</strong> recommendations from people they know; 70% trust unknown users, 27% trust experts, 14% trust advertising, <strong>8% trust celebrities</strong> (Econsultancy, July 2009, Erik Qualman, Socialnomics)</li>
<li><strong>70%</strong> consult reviews or ratings <strong><em>before</em> purchasing</strong> (BusinessWeek, Oct. 2008)</li>
<li><strong>7 in 10</strong> who read reviews <strong>share</strong> them with friends, family &amp; colleagues thus amplifying their impact (Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sept. 2007)</li>
<li><strong>45%</strong> say they are <strong>influenced</strong> a fair amount or a great deal by reviews on social sites from people they follow (46% say reviews in newspaper or magazine influence them.) (Harris Poll, April 2010)</li>

      <p>Business books will be written about the amazing story of the new Fastnet Line <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Ferry to Ireland</a>. This much needed service operating from <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/">Swansea to Cork</a> is proving to be a major success for the region.

</p>
<p>Whilst reviews are important for any business, their importance to new businesses cannot be under-estimated. The <a href="http://www.fastnetline.com/ireland_ferry_reviews.html">response from travellers</a> has been phenomenal since reviews were turned on last week. The unique direct feedback has enabled Fastnet Line to immediately discover what is working very well and what can potentially be changed or improved.</p>

        Parcel2Ship Reviews Powered by LouderVoice

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We are often asked what types of business are most suited to reviews. Our answer is “all of them”! LouderVoice recently went live with a UK site called <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/">Parcel2Ship</a> which offers a brilliantly simple but powerful service. They have aggregated all the parcel and document delivery services so that you just enter a destination and package size and they show you all the options and prices available.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.parcel2ship.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Parcel2Ship" src="https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/30/parcel2ship-reviews-powered-by-loudervoice/p2slogo.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="55" /></a>
</p>
<p>If only we had known about the service when we were going to Internet World in London in May! We bounced from site to site to site trying to find the best price/delivery combination. Parcel2Ship would have saved us hours of effort and stress.</p>

      <p>Those of you who have followed LouderVoice over the past few years have probably noticed that things have changed a lot in the last few months. All of those changes have been for the better and much of it is due to Karl Llewellyn, our new Head of Sales.</p>
<p>Karl is responsible for driving our new partner strategy and recruiting web professionals as partners so they can offer LouderVoice to their customers. Loudervoice already has customers internationally, but partners are a key part of our formal launch into the UK this year.</p>

</p>
<p>We didn’t make the Top Ten yet but that’s OK, we’ll be there in 2010 🙂</p>
<p>What we did make was the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_international_web_products_of_2009p2.php">Honourable Mentions list</a>!</p>
<p>The only Irish web company to do so.</p>
<p>The Golden Spiders award was national recognition for what we’ve been doing this year and now this is global.</p>
<p>To be in the same story as Spotify, Moshi Monsters, Tweetmeme and all the others is a real honour.</p>
