      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were very interested to see an MSNBC article on how hotels are &lt;a href=&#34;http://travelkit.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/22/12188135-how-hotels-are-embracing-online-customer-reviews?lite&#34;&gt;embracing online customer reviews&lt;/a&gt;. It matches our own experience, as our reviewing solutions are proving a major hit with businesses in the hospitality and travel sectors everywhere. We have seen a string of deployments in UK, Ireland, France and the US in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of this growth, we’re delighted to announce that we have have just gone live with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dalatahotelgroup.com/&#34;&gt;the Dalata Group’s&lt;/a&gt; 11 Maldron and 14 partner hotels in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&lt;/a&gt; was a superb event. I spoke on the value of customer reviews but I learned 10x that from the other speakers on all of the online marketing (and other) challenges/opportunities being faced by hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760&#34; title=&#34;Hotel Website Marketing Conference&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;507&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03.jpg 724w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/10/loudervoice-exhibiting-at-the-hotel-website-marketing-conference/hwmfff_03-300x62.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciarán and the team have outdone themselves this year with the speaker line-up. As we just couldn’t miss it, we’ve decided to exhibit there too. Keep an eye out for the LouderVoice stand and pop over for a chat. We can tell you how these businesses and others in the the hospitality industry are benefiting from customer reviews and how your hotel could too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hospitality industry is a big focus for LouderVoice at the moment.

      <title>Hotel Website Marketing Event</title>
      <link>https://loudervoice.com/blog/2009/11/25/hotel-website-marketing-event/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/&#34;&gt;Hotel Website Marketing&lt;/a&gt; event in Dublin organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/&#34;&gt;Proactiv Marketing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s always a pleasure to meet like-minded people who understand the power of online reviews for businesses. Pat O’Neill of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelconsult.ie/&#34;&gt;HotelConsult&lt;/a&gt; is one of those people and we’re thrilled to be working with him in the hotel space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these difficult times for hotels, any advantage that they can gain is worthwhile. On-site reviews are a proven way of growing sales and on-site sales for hotels means they improve their margin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
