      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s always a pleasure to meet like-minded people who understand the power of online reviews for businesses. Pat O’Neill of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hotelconsult.ie/&#34;&gt;HotelConsult&lt;/a&gt; is one of those people and we’re thrilled to be working with him in the hotel space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these difficult times for hotels, any advantage that they can gain is worthwhile. On-site reviews are a proven way of growing sales and on-site sales for hotels means they improve their margin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
