      <p>Yesterday I attended the excellent <a href="http://www.hotelwebsitemarketing.com/">Hotel Website Marketing</a> event in Dublin organised by <a href="http://www.proactivmarketing.ie/">Proactiv Marketing</a>. It was a real highlight of 2009 for me with fantastic speaker after fantastic speaker. I walked away with a ton of to-dos for LouderVoice.</p>
<p>I spoke on the benefit of on-site customer reviews for hotels. The core message was that you can grow on-site sales, reduce online ad spend and improve your customer service by adding reviews to your site.</p>

<p>Since then we’ve played and tweaked mini-reviews based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Following more research we realised that many people were doing mini-reviews using the simple method of just adding #review on to the end of the tweet. This was also the preferred approach in our recent poll.</p>

      <p>As you probably know, LouderVoice was the first company to identify Twitter as an important source of reviews. We launched LouderTweets structured reviews all the way back in June 2007. We are also the people behind the @review user.</p>
<p>Whilst many people have used the structured reviews since then, many others have found the structure difficult to remember or just plain awkward.</p>
<p>We turned on free-form reviews on SMS last year and most people are much happier with that. They simply send an SMS to us beginning with “RE” (or one of our partners’ keywords) and the remainder of the review is in whatever style they like.</p>

      <p>We’ve had a fantastic year in <a href="https://loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a> and it looks like 2009 is going to be even better with a raft of new releases in the next few months. Looking back over last year we achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/01/29/easy-blog-reviews-with-flag-tags/">Flag Tag reviewing</a> which enabled any blogger to have their blog reviews collected by LouderVoice with two simple tags on a post.</li>
<li>We also added Twitter/SMS/Jaiku hashtag support</li>
<li>In February we sponsored the Best Blog Post in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Blog Awards</a></li>
<li>In March we did our first major revamp with LouderVoice V2 adding on-site reviews and a ton of other features.</li>
<li>We also launched V2 of our WordPress Plugin. (Updated Plugin for WP 2.7 coming very soon!)</li>
<li>We spent from April to October busy fixing bugs and building our B2B offering</li>
<li>In July we started using <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/loudervoice">Get Satisfaction</a> for Customer support. Don’t hesitate to add bug reports or feature requests there.</li>
<li>In September we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/09/14/announcing-simple-sms-reviews/">Simple SMS reviews</a> requiring just a single keyword</li>
<li>We were also Shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.awards.ie/">Irish Web Awards</a></li>
<li>In October we launched <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice for Business</a> to great attention</li>
<li>We were also <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/2008/10/15/loudervoice-nominated-for-new-company-of-the-year/">shortlisted in the Irish Software Association Awards</a></li>
<li>And we kicked off our BES 2008 Offering for Irish Investors</li>
<li>In November, our first B2B client, <a href="http://www.klipsch.co.uk/">Klipsch</a>, went live</li>
<li>In December we successfully closed a BES investment round which will ensure our continued success through 2009</li>

<p>As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There’ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews. We also provide custom keywords for our business clients and partners.</p>
