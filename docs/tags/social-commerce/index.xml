      <description>My talk on customer reviews at the IIA&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&amp;#8221; event seemed to go down very well.
Judge for yourself. Hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll find it useful.</description>

      <description>The IIA is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called &amp;#8220;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&amp;#8220;, it&amp;#8217;s all about selling online and multi-channel.
The focus this time is &amp;#8220;Content and Analysis&amp;#8221; and therefore it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we&amp;#8217;ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.</description>

      <title>Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>To describe Riverdance as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.
 The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn&amp;#8217;t have been more excited.</description>
