      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/&#34;&gt;IIA&lt;/a&gt; is running a follow-up to their very successful retail event late last year. Called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iia.ie/events/event/316/8-more-ways-to-sell-even-more-stuff/&#34;&gt;8 More Ways to Sell Even More Stuff&lt;/a&gt;“, it’s all about selling online and multi-channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The focus this time is “Content and Analysis” and therefore it’s no surprise that LouderVoice will be there talking about Social Commerce and how you can power that with Social-enabled Customer Reviews. No serious online business can ignore what their customers are saying about them and we’ll show just how easy it is to benefit from those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Riverdance Steps Out with LouderVoice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To describe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com&#34;&gt;Riverdance&lt;/a&gt; as a global entertainment phenomenon is to undersell it. Over the past sixteen years, millions of people have seen the show in places ranging from Sligo to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riverdance.com/the-show/fan-reviews/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1906  aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Riverdance Reviews&#34; src=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;83&#34; srcset=&#34;https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post.png 550w, https://loudervoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/14/riverdance-steps-out-with-loudervoice/riverdance_blog_post-300x45.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Riverdance team decided to go with a totally new site towards the end of 2010 and the result is an absolute triumph. When they contacted us about powering the reviews for them, we couldn’t have been more excited. We quickly deployed our Social Commerce Reviews solution on the site and you can now review both the overall experience and every individual show. Of course we have Facebook and Twitter baked in so everyone can get the message out about how much they love Riverdance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
