      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a great piece over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/7622-why-a-negative-review-may-not-be-negative-at-all&#34;&gt;Econsultancy about negative reviews&lt;/a&gt;. Well worth a read. It can be hard for businesses to display negative reviews on their site but in the end, everyone benefits. My take-away quote from the article:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of reviews as positive or negative is not helpful. It stops us from considering and building on what this information is really about, which is informing and influencing the decisions others will make after reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
