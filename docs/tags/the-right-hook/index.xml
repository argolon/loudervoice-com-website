      <description>The third winner in the Three competition on The Right Hook has been announced onÂ Georgeâ€™s radio show. It is SarahMcÂ from Waterford who wrote a review of a very interesting device called the Scansound Unilateral Stereo Headphone.

      <description>Conor is on The Right Hook radio show this evening on Newstalk with Joe Drumgoole from PutPlace. He&amp;#8217;ll be talking about the LouderVoice service in general and kicking off an SMS reviews push in conjunction with the show. You can listen live on the web here.
As part of this, we are launching our Simple SMS Review service. There&amp;#8217;ll be more detail in the next post but the key point is that unlike the existing service, no structure is required on your reviews.</description>
